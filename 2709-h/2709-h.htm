    <h2>
      INTRODUCTORY NOTE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      OUT of the darkest depths of life, where vice and crime and misery abound,
      comes the Byron of the twentieth century, the poet of the vagabond and the
      proletariat, Maxim Gorky. Not like the beggar, humbly imploring for a
      crust in the name of the Lord, nor like the jeweller displaying his
      precious stones to dazzle and tempt the eye, he comes to the world,&mdash;nay,
      in accents of Tyrtaeus this commoner of Nizhni Novgorod spurs on his
      troops of freedom-loving heroes to conquer, as it were, the placid,
      self-satisfied literatures of to-day, and bring new life to pale,
      bloodless frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Byron&rsquo;s impassioned utterances, &ldquo;borne on the tones of a wild and
      quite artless melody,&rdquo; is Gorky&rsquo;s mad, unbridled, powerful voice, as he
      sings of the &ldquo;madness of the brave,&rdquo; of the barefooted dreamers, who are
      proud of their idleness, who possess nothing and fear nothing, who are gay
      in their misery, though miserable in their joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gorky&rsquo;s voice is not the calm, cultivated, well-balanced voice of Chekhov,
      the Russian De Maupassant, nor even the apostolic, well-meaning, but
      comparatively faint voice of Tolstoy, the preacher: it is the roaring of a
      lion, the crash of thunder. In its elementary power is the heart rending
      cry of a sincere but suffering soul that saw the brutality of life in all
      its horrors, and now flings its experiences into the face of the world
      with unequalled sympathy and the courage of a giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Gorky, above all, has courage; he dares to say that he finds the
      vagabond, the outcast of society, more sublime and significant than
      society itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Bosyak, the symbolic incarnation of the Over-man, is as naive and as
      bold as a child&mdash;or as a genius. In the vehement passions of the
      magnanimous, compassionate hero in tatters, in the aristocracy of his
      soul, and in his constant thirst for Freedom, Gorky sees the rebellious
      and irreconcilable spirit of man, of future man,&mdash;in these he sees
      something beautiful, something powerful, something monumental, and is
      carried away by their strange psychology. For the barefooted dreamer&rsquo;s
      life is Gorky&rsquo;s life, his ideals are Gorky&rsquo;s ideals, his pleasures and
      pains, Gorky&rsquo;s pleasures and pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Gorky, though broken in health now, buffeted by the storms of fate,
      bruised and wounded in the battle-field of life, still like Byron and like
      Lermontov,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;&mdash;seeks the storm
     As though the storm contained repose.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And in a leonine voice he cries defiantly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Let the storm rage with greater force and fury!&rdquo;
 </pre>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      ABOUT sixty years ago, when fortunes of millions had been made on the
      Volga with fairy-tale rapidity, Ignat Gordyeeff, a young fellow, was
      working as water-pumper on one of the barges of the wealthy merchant
      Zayev.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built like a giant, handsome and not at all stupid, he was one of those
      people whom luck always follows everywhere&mdash;not because they are
      gifted and industrious, but rather because, having an enormous stock of
      energy at their command, they cannot stop to think over the choice of
      means when on their way toward their aims, and, excepting their own will,
      they know no law. Sometimes they speak of their conscience with fear,
      sometimes they really torture themselves struggling with it, but
      conscience is an unconquerable power to the faint-hearted only; the strong
      master it quickly and make it a slave to their desires, for they
      unconsciously feel that, given room and freedom, conscience would fracture
      life. They sacrifice days to it; and if it should happen that conscience
      conquered their souls, they are never wrecked, even in defeat&mdash;they
      are just as healthy and strong under its sway as when they lived without
      conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of forty Ignat Gordyeeff was himself the owner of three
      steamers and ten barges. On the Volga he was respected as a rich and
      clever man, but was nicknamed &ldquo;Frantic,&rdquo; because his life did not flow
      along a straight channel, like that of other people of his kind, but now
      and again, boiling up turbulently, ran out of its rut, away from gain&mdash;the
      prime aim of his existence. It looked as though there were three
      Gordyeeffs in him, or as though there were three souls in Ignat&rsquo;s body.
      One of them, the mightiest, was only greedy, and when Ignat lived
      according to its commands, he was merely a man seized with untamable
      passion for work. This passion burned in him by day and by night, he was
      completely absorbed by it, and, grabbing everywhere hundreds and thousands
      of roubles, it seemed as if he could never have enough of the jingle and
      sound of money. He worked about up and down the Volga, building and
      fastening nets in which he caught gold: he bought up grain in the
      villages, floated it to Rybinsk on his barges; he plundered, cheated,
      sometimes not noticing it, sometimes noticing, and, triumphant, be openly
      laughed at by his victims; and in the senselessness of his thirst for
      money, he rose to the heights of poetry. But, giving up so much strength
      to this hunt after the rouble, he was not greedy in the narrow sense, and
      sometimes he even betrayed an inconceivable but sincere indifference to
      his property. Once, when the ice was drifting down the Volga, he stood on
      the shore, and, seeing that the ice was breaking his new barge, having
      crushed it against the bluff shore, he ejaculated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. Again. Crush it! Now, once more! Try!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Ignat,&rdquo; asked his friend Mayakin, coming up to him, &ldquo;the ice is
      crushing about ten thousand out of your purse, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing! I&rsquo;ll make another hundred. But look how the Volga is
      working! Eh? Fine? She can split the whole world, like curd, with a knife.
      Look, look! There you have my &lsquo;Boyarinya!&rsquo; She floated but once. Well,
      we&rsquo;ll have mass said for the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The barge was crushed into splinters. Ignat and the godfather, sitting in
      the tavern on the shore, drank vodka and looked out of the window,
      watching the fragments of the &ldquo;Boyarinya&rdquo; drifting down the river together
      with the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sorry for the vessel, Ignat?&rdquo; asked Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I be sorry for it? The Volga gave it to me, and the Volga has
      taken it back. It did not tear off my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevertheless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;nevertheless? It is good at least that I saw how it was all
      done. It&rsquo;s a lesson for the future. But when my &lsquo;Volgar&rsquo; was burned&mdash;I
      was really sorry&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t see it. How beautiful it must have looked
      when such a woodpile was blazing on the water in the dark night! Eh? It
      was an enormous steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you sorry for that either?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the steamer? It is true, I did feel sorry for the steamer. But then
      it is mere foolishness to feel sorry! What&rsquo;s the use? I might have cried;
      tears cannot extinguish fire. Let the steamers burn. And even though
      everything be burned down, I&rsquo;d spit upon it! If the soul is but burning to
      work, everything will be erected anew. Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mayakin, smiling. &ldquo;These are strong words you say. And whoever
      speaks that way, even though he loses all, will nevertheless be rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regarding losses of thousands of roubles so philosophically, Ignat knew
      the value of every kopeika; he gave to the poor very seldom, and only to
      those that were altogether unable to work. When a more or less healthy man
      asked him for alms, Ignat would say, sternly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away! You can work yet. Go to my dvornik and help him to remove the
      dung. I&rsquo;ll pay you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whenever he had been carried away by his work he regarded people morosely
      and piteously, nor did he give himself rest while hunting for roubles. And
      suddenly&mdash;it usually happened in spring, when everything on earth
      became so bewitchingly beautiful and something reproachfully wild was
      breathed down into the soul from the clear sky&mdash;Ignat Gordyeeff would
      feel that he was not the master of his business, but its low slave. He
      would lose himself in thought and, inquisitively looking about himself
      from under his thick, knitted eyebrows, walk about for days, angry and
      morose, as though silently asking something, which he feared to ask aloud.
      They awakened his other soul, the turbulent and lustful soul of a hungry
      beast. Insolent and cynical, he drank, led a depraved life, and made
      drunkards of other people. He went into ecstasy, and something like a
      volcano of filth boiled within him. It looked as though he was madly
      tearing the chains which he himself had forged and carried, and was not
      strong enough to tear them. Excited and very dirty, his face swollen from
      drunkenness and sleeplessness, his eyes wandering madly, and roaring in a
      hoarse voice, he tramped about the town from one tavern to another, threw
      away money without counting it, cried and danced to the sad tunes of the
      folk songs, or fought, but found no rest anywhere&mdash;in anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened one day that a degraded priest, a short, stout little
      bald-headed man in a torn cassock, chanced on Ignat, and stuck to him,
      just as a piece of mud will stick to a shoe. An impersonal, deformed and
      nasty creature, he played the part of a buffoon: they smeared his bald
      head with mustard, made him go upon all-fours, drink mixtures of different
      brandies and dance comical dances; he did all this in silence, an idiotic
      smile on his wrinkled face, and having done what he was told to do, he
      invariably said, outstretching his hand with his palm upward:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a rouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laughed at him and sometimes gave him twenty kopeiks, sometimes gave
      him nothing, but it sometimes happened that they threw him a ten-rouble
      bill and even more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You abominable fellow,&rdquo; cried Ignat to him one day. &ldquo;Say, who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest was frightened by the call, and bowing low to Ignat, was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Speak!&rdquo; roared Ignat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a man&mdash;to be abused,&rdquo; answered the priest, and the company
      burst out laughing at his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a rascal?&rdquo; asked Ignat, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rascal? Because of need and the weakness of my soul?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; Ignat called him. &ldquo;Come and sit down by my side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trembling with fear, the priest walked up to the intoxicated merchant with
      timid steps and remained standing opposite him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down beside me!&rdquo; said Ignat, taking the frightened priest by the hand
      and seating him next to himself. &ldquo;You are a very near man to me. I am also
      a rascal! You, because of need; I, because of wantonness. I am a rascal
      because of grief! Understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the priest, softly. All the company were giggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know now what I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, say, &lsquo;You are a rascal, Ignat!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest could not do it. He looked with terror at the huge figure of
      Ignat and shook his head negatively. The company&rsquo;s laughter was now like
      the rattling of thunder. Ignat could not make the priest abuse him. Then
      he asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I give you money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; quickly answered the priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you need it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not care to answer. Then Ignat seized him by the collar, and shook
      out of his dirty lips the following speech, which he spoke almost in a
      whisper, trembling with fear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a daughter sixteen years old in the seminary. I save for her,
      because when she comes out there won&rsquo;t be anything with which to cover her
      nakedness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Ignat, and let go the priest&rsquo;s collar. Then he sat for a long
      time gloomy and lost in thought, and now and again stared at the priest.
      Suddenly his eyes began to laugh, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a liar, drunkard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest silently made the sign of the cross and lowered his head on his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the truth!&rdquo; said one of the company, confirming the priest&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True? Very well!&rdquo; shouted Ignat, and, striking the table with his fist,
      he addressed himself to the priest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you! Sell me your daughter! How much will you take?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest shook his head and shrank back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thousand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The company giggled, seeing that the priest was shrinking as though cold
      water was being poured on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two!&rdquo; roared Ignat, with flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? How is it?&rdquo; muttered the priest, stretching
      out both hands to Ignat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ignat Matveyich!&rdquo; cried the priest, in a thin, ringing voice. &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s
      sake! For Christ&rsquo;s sake! Enough! I&rsquo;ll sell her! For her own sake I&rsquo;ll sell
      her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In his sickly, sharp voice was heard a threat to someone, and his eyes,
      unnoticed by anybody before, flashed like coals. But the intoxicated crowd
      only laughed at him foolishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried Ignat, sternly, straightening himself to his full length
      and flashing his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand, devils, what&rsquo;s going on here? It&rsquo;s enough to make
      one cry, while you giggle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked up to the priest, went down on his knees before him, and said to
      him firmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father now you see what a rascal I am. Well, spit into my face!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something ugly and ridiculous took place. The priest too, knelt before
      Ignat, and like a huge turtle, crept around near his feet, kissed his
      knees and muttered something, sobbing. Ignat bent over him, lifted him
      from the floor and cried to him, commanding and begging:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spit! Spit right into my shameless eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The company, stupefied for a moment by Ignat&rsquo;s stern voice, laughed again
      so that the panes rattled in the tavern windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a hundred roubles. Spit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the priest crept over the floor and sobbed for fear, or for happiness,
      to hear that this man was begging him to do something degrading to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Ignat arose from the floor, kicked the priest, and, flinging at
      him a package of money, said morosely, with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rabble! Can a man repent before such people? Some are afraid to hear of
      repentance, others laugh at a sinner. I was about to unburden myself
      completely; the heart trembled. Let me, I thought. No, I didn&rsquo;t think at
      all. Just so! Get out of here! And see that you never show yourself to me
      again. Do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, a queer fellow!&rdquo; said the crowd, somewhat moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legends were composed about his drinking bouts in town; everybody censured
      him strictly, but no one ever declined his invitation to those drinking
      bouts. Thus he lived for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      And unexpectedly he used to come home, not yet altogether freed from the
      odour of the kabaks, but already crestfallen and quiet. With humbly
      downcast eyes, in which shame was burning now, he silently listened to his
      wife&rsquo;s reproaches, and, humble and meek as a lamb, went away to his room
      and locked himself in. For many hours in succession he knelt before the
      cross, lowering his head on his breast; his hands hung helplessly, his
      back was bent, and he was silent, as though he dared not pray. His wife
      used to come up to the door on tiptoe and listen. Deep sighs were heard
      from behind the door&mdash;like the breathing of a tired and sickly horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God! You see,&rdquo; whispered Ignat in a muffled voice, firmly pressing the
      palms of his hands to his broad breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the days of repentance he drank nothing but water and ate only rye
      bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning his wife placed at the door of his room a big bottle of
      water, about a pound and a half of bread, and salt. He opened the door,
      took in these victuals and locked himself in again. During this time he
      was not disturbed in any way; everybody tried to avoid him. A few days
      later he again appeared on the exchange, jested, laughed, made contracts
      to furnish corn as sharp-sighted as a bird of prey, a rare expert at
      anything concerning his affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in all the moods of Ignat&rsquo;s life there was one passionate desire that
      never left him&mdash;the desire to have a son; and the older he grew the
      greater was this desire. Very often such conversation as this took place
      between him and his wife. In the morning, at her tea, or at noon during
      dinner hour he gloomily glared at his wife, a stout, well-fed woman, with
      a red face and sleepy eyes, and asked her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you feel anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew what he meant, but she invariably replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help feeling? Your fists are like dumb-bells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what I&rsquo;m talking about, you fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can one become pregnant from such blows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not on account of the blows that you don&rsquo;t bear any children; it&rsquo;s
      because you eat too much. You fill your stomach with all sorts of food&mdash;and
      there&rsquo;s no room for the child to engender.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I didn&rsquo;t bear you any children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those were girls,&rdquo; said Ignat, reproachfully. &ldquo;I want a son! Do you
      understand? A son, an heir! To whom shall I give my capital after my
      death? Who shall pray for my sins? Shall I give it to a cloister? I have
      given them enough! Or shall I leave it to you? What a fine pilgrim you
      are! Even in church you think only of fish pies. If I die, you&rsquo;ll marry
      again, and my money will be turned over to some fool. Do you think this is
      what I am working for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he was seized with sardonic anguish, for he felt that his life was
      aimless if he should have no son to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the nine years of their married life his wife had borne him four
      daughters, all of whom had passed away. While Ignat had awaited their
      birth tremblingly, he mourned their death but little&mdash;at any rate
      they were unnecessary to him. He began to beat his wife during the second
      year of their married life; at first he did it while being intoxicated and
      without animosity, but just according to the proverb: &ldquo;Love your wife like
      your soul and shake her like a pear-tree;&rdquo; but after each confinement,
      deceived in his expectation, his hatred for his wife grew stronger, and he
      began to beat her with pleasure, in revenge for not bearing him a son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once while on business in the province of Samarsk, he received a telegram
      from relatives at home, informing him of his wife&rsquo;s death. He made the
      sign of the cross, thought awhile and wrote to his friend Mayakin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bury her in my absence; look after my property.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went to the church to serve the mass for the dead, and, having
      prayed for the repose of the late Aquilina&rsquo;s soul, he began to think that
      it was necessary for him to marry as soon as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was then forty-three years old, tall, broad-shouldered, with a heavy
      bass voice, like an arch-deacon; his large eyes looked bold and wise from
      under his dark eyebrows; in his sunburnt face, overgrown with a thick,
      black beard, and in all his mighty figure there was much truly Russian,
      crude and healthy beauty; in his easy motions as well as in his slow,
      proud walk, a consciousness of power was evident&mdash;a firm confidence
      in himself. He was liked by women and did not avoid them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere six months had passed after the death of his wife, he courted the
      daughter of an Ural Cossack. The father of the bride, notwithstanding that
      Ignat was known even in Ural as a &ldquo;pranky&rdquo; man, gave him his daughter in
      marriage, and toward autumn Ignat Gordyeeff came home with a young
      Cossack-wife. Her name was Natalya. Tall, well-built, with large blue eyes
      and with a long chestnut braid, she was a worthy match for the handsome
      Ignat. He was happy and proud of his wife and loved her with the
      passionate love of a healthy man, but he soon began to contemplate her
      thoughtfully, with a vigilant eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seldom did a smile cross the oval, demure face of his wife&mdash;she was
      always thinking of something foreign to life, and in her calm blue eyes
      something dark and misanthropic was flashing at times. Whenever she was
      free from household duties she seated herself in the most spacious room by
      the window, and sat there silently for two or three hours. Her face was
      turned toward the street, but the look of her eyes was so indifferent to
      everything that lived and moved there beyond the window, and at the same
      time it was so fixedly deep, as though she were looking into her very
      soul. And her walk, too, was queer. Natalya moved about the spacious room
      slowly and carefully, as if something invisible restrained the freedom of
      her movements. Their house was filled with heavy and coarsely boastful
      luxury; everything there was resplendent, screaming of the proprietor&rsquo;s
      wealth, but the Cossack-wife walked past the costly furniture and the
      silverware in a shy and somewhat frightened manner, as though fearing lest
      they might seize and choke her. Evidently, the noisy life of the big
      commercial town did not interest this silent woman, and whenever she went
      out driving with her husband, her eyes were fixed on the back of the
      driver. When her husband took her visiting she went and behaved there just
      as queerly as at home; when guests came to her house, she zealously served
      them refreshments, taking no interest whatever in what was said, and
      showing preference toward none. Only Mayakin, a witty, droll man, at times
      called forth on her face a smile, as vague as a shadow. He used to say of
      her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tree&mdash;not a woman! But life is like an inextinguishable
      wood-pile, and every one of us blazes up sometimes. She, too, will take
      fire; wait, give her time. Then we shall see how she will bloom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; Ignat used to say to her jestingly. &ldquo;What are you thinking about?
      Are you homesick? Brighten up a bit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She would remain silent, calmly looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go entirely too often to the church. You should wait. You have plenty
      of time to pray for your sins. Commit the sins first. You know, if you
      don&rsquo;t sin you don&rsquo;t repent; if you don&rsquo;t repent, you don&rsquo;t work out your
      salvation. You better sin while you are young. Shall we go out for a
      drive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like going out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He used to sit down beside her and embrace her. She was cold, returning
      his caresses but sparingly. Looking straight into her eyes, he used to
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natalya! Tell me&mdash;why are you so sad? Do you feel lonesome here with
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then is it? Are you longing for your people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once he managed to get from her a more complete answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something confused in my heart. And also in my eyes. And it
      always seems to me that all this is not real.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She waved her hand around her, pointing at the walls, the furniture and
      everything. Ignat did not reflect on her words, and, laughing, said to
      her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s to no purpose! Everything here is genuine. All these are costly,
      solid things. If you don&rsquo;t want these, I&rsquo;ll burn them, I&rsquo;ll sell them,
      I&rsquo;ll give them away&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll get new ones! Do you want me to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; said she calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered, at last, how one so young and healthy could live as though
      she were sleeping all the time, caring for nothing, going nowhere, except
      to the church, and shunning everybody. And he used to console her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just wait. You&rsquo;ll bear a son, and then an altogether different life will
      commence. You are so sad because you have so little anxiety, and he will
      give you trouble. You&rsquo;ll bear me a son, will you not?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it pleases God,&rdquo; she answered, lowering her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her mood began to irritate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why do you wear such a long face? You walk as though on glass. You
      look as if you had ruined somebody&rsquo;s soul! Eh! You are such a succulent
      woman, and yet you have no taste for anything. Fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coming home intoxicated one day, he began to ply her with caresses, while
      she turned away from him. Then he grew angry, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natalya! Don&rsquo;t play the fool, look out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her face to him and asked calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ignat became enraged at these words and at her fearless look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he roared, coming up close to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish to kill me?&rdquo; asked she, not moving from her place, nor
      winking an eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignat was accustomed to seeing people tremble before his wrath, and it was
      strange and offensive to him to see her calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he cried, lifting his hand to strike her. Slowly, but in time,
      she eluded the blow; then she seized his hand, pushed it away from her,
      and said in the same tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to touch me. I will not allow you to come near me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes became smaller and their sharp, metallic glitter sobered Ignat.
      He understood by her face that she, too, was a strong beast, and if she
      chose to she wouldn&rsquo;t admit him to her, even though she were to lose her
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he growled, and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But having retreated once, he would not do it again: he could not bear
      that a woman, and his wife at that, should not bow before him&mdash;this
      would have degraded him. He then began to realise that henceforth his wife
      would never yield to him in any matter, and that an obstinate strife for
      predominance must start between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! We&rsquo;ll see who will conquer,&rdquo; he thought the next day, watching
      his wife with stern curiosity; and in his soul a strong desire was already
      raging to start the strife, that he might enjoy his victory the sooner.
    </p>
    <p>
      But about four days later, Natalya Fominichna announced to her husband
      that she was pregnant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignat trembled for joy, embraced her firmly, and said in a dull voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine fellow, Natalya! Natasha, if it should be a son! If you
      bear me a son I&rsquo;ll enrich you! I tell you plainly, I&rsquo;ll be your slave! By
      God! I&rsquo;ll lie down at your feet, and you may trample upon me, if you
      like!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not within our power; it&rsquo;s the will of the Lord,&rdquo; said she in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the Lord&rsquo;s!&rdquo; exclaimed Ignat with bitterness and drooped his head
      sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment he began to look after his wife as though she were a
      little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you sit near the window? Look out. You&rsquo;ll catch cold in your side;
      you may take sick,&rdquo; he used to say to her, both sternly and mildly. &ldquo;Why
      do you skip on the staircase? You may hurt yourself. And you had better
      eat more, eat for two, that he may have enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the pregnancy made Natalya more morose and silent, as though she were
      looking still deeper into herself, absorbed in the throbbing of new life
      within her. But the smile on her lips became clearer, and in her eyes
      flashed at times something new, weak and timid, like the first ray of the
      dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at last, the time of confinement came, it was early on an autumn
      morning. At the first cry of pain she uttered, Ignat turned pale and
      started to say something, but only waved his hand and left the bedroom,
      where his wife was shrinking convulsively, and went down to the little
      room which had served his late mother as a chapel. He ordered vodka,
      seated himself by the table and began to drink sternly, listening to the
      alarm in the house and to the moans of his wife that came from above. In
      the corner of the room, the images of the ikons, indifferent and dark,
      stood out confusedly, dimly illumined by the glimmering light of the image
      lamp. There was a stamping and scraping of feet over his head, something
      heavy was moved from one side of the floor to the other, there was a
      clattering of dishes, people were bustling hurriedly, up and down the
      staircase. Everything was being done in haste, yet time was creeping
      slowly. Ignat could hear a muffled voice from above,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it seems, she cannot be delivered that way. We had better send to the
      church to open the gates of the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vassushka, one of the hangers-on in his house, entered the room next to
      Ignat&rsquo;s and began to pray in a loud whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God, our Lord, descend from the skies in Thy benevolence, born of the
      Holy Virgin. Thou dost divine the helplessness of human creatures. Forgive
      Thy servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly drowning all other sounds, a superhuman, soul-rending cry
      rang out, and a continuous moan floated softly over the room and died out
      in the corners, which were filled now with the twilight. Ignat cast stern
      glances at the ikons, heaved a deep sigh and thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible that it&rsquo;s again a daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At times he arose, stupidly stood in the middle of the room, and crossed
      himself in silence, bowing before the ikons; then he went back to the
      table, drank the vodka, which had not made him dizzy during these hours,
      dozed off, and thus passed the whole night and following morning until
      noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, at last, the midwife came down hastily, crying to him in a thin,
      joyous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you with a son, Ignat Matveyich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; said he in a dull voice. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you,
      batushka!&rdquo; Heaving a sigh with all the strength of his massive chest,
      Ignat went down on his knees, and clasping his hands firmly to his breast,
      muttered in a trembling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God! Evidently Thou didst not want that my stem should be checked!
      My sins before Thee shall not remain without repentance. I thank Thee, Oh
      Lord. Oh!&rdquo; and, rising to his feet, he immediately began to command
      noisily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! Let someone go to St. Nicholas for a priest. Tell him that Ignat
      Matveyich asked him to come! Let him come to make a prayer for the woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The chambermaid appeared and said to him with alarm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ignat Matveyich, Natalya Fominichna is calling you. She is feeling bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why bad? It&rsquo;ll pass!&rdquo; he roared, his eyes flashing cheerfully. &ldquo;Tell her
      I&rsquo;ll be there immediately! Tell her she&rsquo;s a fine fellow! I&rsquo;ll just get a
      present for her and I&rsquo;ll come! Hold on! Prepare something to eat for the
      priest. Send somebody after Mayakin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His enormous figure looked as though it had grown bigger, and intoxicated
      with joy, he stupidly tossed about the room; he was smiling, rubbing his
      hands and casting fervent glances at the images; he crossed himself
      swinging his hand wide. At last he went up to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes first of all caught a glimpse of the little red body, which the
      midwife was bathing in a tub. Noticing him, Ignat stood up on tiptoes,
      and, folding his hands behind his back, walked up to him, stepping
      carefully and comically putting forth his lips. The little one was
      whimpering and sprawling in the water, naked, impotent and pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out there! Handle him more carefully! He hasn&rsquo;t got any bones yet,&rdquo;
       said Ignat to the midwife, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to laugh, opening her toothless mouth, and cleverly throwing the
      child over from one hand to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better go to your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obediently moved toward the bed and asked on his way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how is it, Natalya?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, on reaching her, he drew back the bed curtain, which had thrown a
      shadow over the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not survive this,&rdquo; said she in a low, hoarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignat was silent, fixedly staring at his wife&rsquo;s face, sunk in the white
      pillow, over which her dark locks were spread out like dead snakes.
      Yellow, lifeless, with black circles around her large, wide-open eyes&mdash;her
      face was strange to him. And the glance of those terrible eyes,
      motionlessly fixed somewhere in the distance through the wall&mdash;that,
      too, was unfamiliar to Ignat. His heart, compressed by a painful
      foreboding, slackened its joyous throbbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing. That&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s always like this,&rdquo; said he softly,
      bending over his wife to give her a kiss. But she moaned right into his
      face:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not survive this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her lips were gray and cold, and when he touched them with his own he
      understood that death was already within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; he uttered, in an alarmed whisper, feeling that fright was
      choking his throat and suppressing his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Natasha? What will become of him? He must be nursed! What is the matter
      with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He almost began to cry at his wife. The midwife was bustling about him;
      shaking the crying child in the air. She spoke to him reassuringly, but he
      heard nothing&mdash;he could not turn his eyes away from the frightful
      face of his wife. Her lips were moving, and he heard words spoken in a low
      voice, but could not understand them. Sitting on the edge of the bed, he
      spoke in a dull and timid voice: &ldquo;Just think of it! He cannot do without
      you; he&rsquo;s an infant! Gather strength! Drive this thought away from you!
      Drive it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He talked, yet he understood he was speaking useless words. Tears welled
      up within him, and in his breast there came a feeling heavy as stone and
      cold as ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me. Goodbye! Take care. Look out. Don&rsquo;t drink,&rdquo; whispered
      Natalya, soundlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest came, and, covering her face with something, and sighing, began
      to read gentle, beseeching words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh God, Almighty Lord, who cureth every disease, cure also Thy servant
      Natalya, who has just given birth to a child; and restore her from the bed
      on which she now lies, for in the words of David, &lsquo;We indulge in
      lawlessness and are wicked in Thine eyes.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s voice was interrupted now and then, his thin face was stern
      and from his clothes came the odour of rock-rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guard the infant born of her, guard him from all possible temptation,
      from all possible cruelty, from all possible storms, from evil spirits,
      night and day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ignat listened to the prayer, and wept silently. His big, hot tears fell
      on the bare hand of his wife. But the hand, evidently, did not feel that
      the tears were dropping upon it: it remained motionless, and the skin did
      not tremble from the fall of the tears. After the prayer Natalya became
      unconscious and a day later she died, without saying another word&mdash;she
      died just as quietly as she had lived. Having arranged a pompous funeral,
      Ignat christened his son, named him Foma, and unwillingly gave his boy
      into the family of the godfather, his old friend Mayakin, whose wife, too,
      had given birth to a child not long before. The death of his wife had sown
      many gray hairs in Ignat&rsquo;s dark beard, but in the stern glitter of his
      eyes appeared a new expression, gentle, clear and mild.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      MAYAKIN lived in an enormous two-story house near a big palisade, where
      sturdy, old spreading linden trees were growing magnificently. The rank
      branches covered the windows with a dense, dark embroidery, and the sun in
      broken rays peeped into the small rooms, which were closely crowded with
      miscellaneous furniture and big trunks, wherefore a stern and melancholy
      semi-darkness always reigned there supreme. The family was devout&mdash;the
      odour of wax, of rock-rose and of image-lamp oil filled the house, and
      penitent sighs and prayers soared about in the air. Religious ceremonials
      were performed infallibly, with pleasure, absorbing all the free power of
      the souls of the dwellers of the house. Feminine figures almost
      noiselessly moved about the rooms in the half-dark, stifling, heavy
      atmosphere. They were dressed in black, wore soft slippers on their feet,
      and always had a penitent look on their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family of Yakov Tarazovich Mayakin consisted of himself, his wife, a
      daughter and five kinswomen, the youngest of whom was thirty-four years
      old. These were alike devout and impersonal, and subordinate to Antonina
      Ivanovna, the mistress of the house. She was a tall, thin woman, with a
      dark face and with stern gray eyes, which had an imperious and intelligent
      expression. Mayakin also had a son Taras, but his name was never mentioned
      in the house; acquaintances knew that since the nineteen-year-old Taras
      had gone to study in Moscow&mdash;he married there three years later,
      against his father&rsquo;s will&mdash;Yakov disowned him. Taras disappeared
      without leaving any trace. It was rumoured that he had been sent to
      Siberia for something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yakov Mayakin was very queerly built. Short, thin, lively, with a little
      red beard, sly greenish eyes, he looked as though he said to each and
      every one:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, sir, don&rsquo;t be uneasy. Even though I know you for what you
      are, if you don&rsquo;t annoy me I will not give you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His beard resembled an egg in shape and was monstrously big. His high
      forehead, covered with wrinkles, joined his bald crown, and it seemed as
      though he really had two faces&mdash;one an open, penetrating and
      intellectual face, with a long gristle nose, and above this face another
      one, eyeless and mouthless, covered with wrinkles, behind which Mayakin
      seemed to hide his eyes and his lips until a certain time; and when that
      time had arrived, he would look at the world with different eyes and smile
      a different smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the owner of a rope-yard and kept a store in town near the harbour.
      In this store, filled up to the ceiling with rope, twine, hemp and tow, he
      had a small room with a creaking glass door. In this room stood a big,
      old, dilapidated table, and near it a deep armchair, covered with
      oilcloth, in which Mayakin sat all day long, sipping tea and always
      reading the same &ldquo;Moskovskiya Vedomosty,&rdquo; to which he subscribed, year in
      and year out, all his life. Among merchants he enjoyed the respect and
      reputation of a &ldquo;brainy&rdquo; man, and he was very fond of boasting of the
      antiquity of his race, saying in a hoarse voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We, the Mayakins, were merchants during the reign of &lsquo;Mother&rsquo; Catherine,
      consequently I am a pure-blooded man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this family Ignat Gordyeeff&rsquo;s son lived for six years. By the time he
      was seven years old Foma was a big-headed, broad-shouldered boy, seemingly
      older that his years, both in his size and in the serious look of his
      dark, almond-shaped eyes. Quiet, silent and persistent in his childish
      desires, he spent all his days over his playthings, with Mayakin&rsquo;s
      daughter, Luba, quietly looked after by one of the kinswomen, a stout,
      pock-marked old maid, who was, for some reason or other, nicknamed
      &ldquo;Buzya.&rdquo; She was a dull, somewhat timid creature; and even to the children
      she spoke in a low voice, in words of monosyllables. Having devoted her
      time to learning prayers, she had no stories to tell Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma was on friendly terms with the little girl, but when she angered or
      teased him he turned pale, his nostrils became distended, his eyes stared
      comically and he beat her audaciously. She cried, ran to her mother and
      complained to her, but Antonina loved Foma and she paid but little
      attention to her daughter&rsquo;s complaints, which strengthened the friendship
      between the children still more. Foma&rsquo;s day was long and uniform. Getting
      out of bed and washing himself, he used to place himself before the image,
      and under the whispering of the pock-marked Buzya he recited long prayers.
      Then they drank tea and ate many biscuits, cakes and pies. After tea&mdash;during
      the summer&mdash;the children went to the big palisade, which ran down to
      a ravine, whose bottom always looked dark and damp, filling them with
      terror. The children were not allowed to go even to the edge of the
      ravine, and this inspired in them a fear of it. In winter, from tea time
      to dinner, they played in the house when it was very cold outside, or went
      out in the yard to slide down the big ice hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had dinner at noon, &ldquo;in Russian style,&rdquo; as Mayakin said. At first a
      big bowl of fat, sour cabbage soup was served with rye biscuits in, but
      without meat, then the same soup was eaten with meat cut into small
      pieces; then they ate roast meat&mdash;pork, goose, veal or rennet, with
      gruel&mdash;then again a bowl of soup with vermicelli, and all this was
      usually followed by dessert. They drank kvass made of red bilberries,
      juniper-berries, or of bread&mdash;Antonina Ivanovna always carried a
      stock of different kinds of kvass. They ate in silence, only now and then
      uttering a sigh of fatigue; the children each ate out of a separate bowl,
      the adults eating out of one bowl. Stupefied by such a dinner, they went
      to sleep; and for two or three hours Mayakin&rsquo;s house was filled with
      snoring and with drowsy sighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awaking from sleep, they drank tea and talked about local news, the
      choristers, the deacons, weddings, or the dishonourable conduct of this or
      that merchant. After tea Mayakin used to say to his wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother, hand me the Bible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yakov Tarasovich used to read the Book of Job more often than anything
      else. Putting his heavy, silver-framed spectacles on his big, ravenous
      nose, he looked around at his listeners to see whether all were in their
      places.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all seated where he was accustomed to see them and on their
      faces was a familiar, dull and timid expression of piety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a man in the land of Uz,&rdquo; began Mayakin, in a hoarse voice, and
      Foma, sitting beside Luba on the lounge in the corner of the room, knew
      beforehand that soon his godfather would become silent and pat his bald
      head with his hand. He sat and, listening, pictured to himself this man
      from the land of Uz. The man was tall and bare, his eyes were enormously
      large, like those of the image of the Saviour, and his voice was like a
      big brass trumpet on which the soldiers played in the camps. The man was
      constantly growing bigger and bigger; and, reaching the sky, he thrust his
      dark hands into the clouds, and, tearing them asunder, cried out in a
      terrible voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged
      in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dread fell on Foma, and he trembled, slumber fled from his eyes, he heard
      the voice of his godfather, who said, with a light smile, now and then
      pinching his beard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how audacious he was!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy knew that his godfather spoke of the man from the land of Uz, and
      the godfather&rsquo;s smile soothed the child. So the man would not break the
      sky; he would not rend it asunder with his terrible arms. And then Foma
      sees the man again&mdash;he sits on the ground, &ldquo;his flesh is clothed with
      worms and clods of dust, his skin is broken.&rdquo; But now he is small and
      wretched, he is like a beggar at the church porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is man, that he should be clean? And he which is born of woman, that
      he should be righteous?&rdquo; [These words attributed by Mayakin to Job are
      from Eliphaz the Temanite&rsquo;s reply&mdash;Translator&rsquo;s Note.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says this to God,&rdquo; explained Mayakin, inspired. &ldquo;How, says he, can I
      be righteous, since I am made of flesh? That&rsquo;s a question asked of God.
      How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the reader, triumphantly and interrogatively looks around at his
      listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He merited it, the righteous man,&rdquo; they replied with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yakov Mayakin eyes them with a smile, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fools! You better put the children to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ignat visited the Mayakins every day, brought playthings for his son,
      caught him up into his arms and hugged him, but sometimes dissatisfied he
      said to him with ill-concealed uneasiness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you such a bugbear? Oh! Why do you laugh so little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he would complain to the lad&rsquo;s godfather:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that he may turn out to be like his mother. His eyes are
      cheerless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You disturb yourself rather too soon,&rdquo; Mayakin smilingly replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, loved his godson, and when Ignat announced to him one day that he
      would take Foma to his own house, Mayakin was very much grieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave him here,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;See, the child is used to us; there! he&rsquo;s
      crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll cease crying. I did not beget him for you. The air of the place is
      disagreeable. It is as tedious here as in an old believer&rsquo;s hermitage.
      This is harmful to the child. And without him I am lonesome. I come home&mdash;it
      is empty. I can see nothing there. It would not do for me to remove to
      your house for his sake. I am not for him, he is for me. So. And now that
      my sister has come to my house there will be somebody to look after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the boy was brought to his father&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he was met by a comical old woman, with a long, hook-like nose and
      with a mouth devoid of teeth. Tall, stooping, dressed in gray, with gray
      hair, covered by a black silk cap, she did not please the boy at first;
      she even frightened him. But when he noticed on the wrinkled face her
      black eyes, which beamed so tenderly on him, he at once pressed his head
      close to her knees in confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sickly little orphan!&rdquo; she said in a velvet-like voice that trembled
      from the fulness of sound, and quietly patted his face with her hand,
      &ldquo;stay close to me, my dear child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something particularly sweet and soft in her caresses, something
      altogether new to Foma, and he stared into the old woman&rsquo;s eyes with
      curiosity and expectation on his face. This old woman led him into a new
      world, hitherto unknown to him. The very first day, having put him to bed,
      she seated herself by his side, and, bending over the child, asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell you a story, Fomushka?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after that Foma always fell asleep amid the velvet-like sounds of the
      old woman&rsquo;s voice, which painted before him a magic life. Giants defeating
      monsters, wise princesses, fools who turned out to be wise&mdash;troops of
      new and wonderful people were passing before the boy&rsquo;s bewitched
      imagination, and his soul was nourished by the wholesome beauty of the
      national creative power. Inexhaustible were the treasures of the memory
      and the fantasy of this old woman, who oftentimes, in slumber, appeared to
      the boy&mdash;now like the witch of the fairy-tales&mdash;only a kind and
      amiable old witch&mdash;now like the beautiful, all-wise Vasilisa. His
      eyes wide open, holding his breath, the boy looked into the darkness that
      filled his chamber and watched it as it slowly trembled in the light of
      the little lamp that was burning before the image. And Foma filled this
      darkness with wonderful pictures of fairy-tale life. Silent, yet living
      shadows, were creeping over the walls and across the floor; it was both
      pleasant and terrible to him to watch their life; to deal out unto them
      forms and colours, and, having endowed them with life, instantly to
      destroy them all with a single twinkle of the eyelashes. Something new
      appeared in his dark eyes, something more childish and naive, less grave;
      the loneliness and the darkness, awaking in him a painful feeling of
      expectation, stirred his curiosity, compelled him to go out to the dark
      corner and see what was hidden there beyond the thick veils of darkness.
      He went and found nothing, but he lost no hope of finding it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He feared his father and respected him. Ignat&rsquo;s enormous size, his harsh,
      trumpet-like voice, his bearded face, his gray-haired head, his powerful,
      long arms and his flashing eyes&mdash;all these gave to Ignat the
      resemblance of the fairy-tale robbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma shuddered whenever he heard his voice or his heavy, firm steps; but
      when the father, smiling kind-heartedly, and talking playfully in a loud
      voice, took him upon his knees or threw him high up in the air with his
      big hands the boy&rsquo;s fear vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, when the boy was about eight years old, he asked his father, who had
      returned from a long journey:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, where were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the Volga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you robbing there?&rdquo; asked Foma, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha-at?&rdquo; Ignat drawled out, and his eyebrows contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a robber, papa? I know it,&rdquo; said Foma, winking his eyes slyly,
      satisfied that he had already read the secret of his father&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a merchant!&rdquo; said Ignat, sternly, but after a moment&rsquo;s thought he
      smiled kind-heartedly and added: &ldquo;And you are a little fool! I deal in
      corn, I run a line of steamers. Have you seen the &lsquo;Yermak&rsquo;? Well, that is
      my steamer. And yours, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very big one,&rdquo; said Foma with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll buy you a small one while you are small yourself. Shall I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; Foma assented, but after a thoughtful silence he again
      drawled out regretfully: &ldquo;But I thought you were a robber or a giant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I am a merchant!&rdquo; repeated Ignat, insinuatingly, and there was
      something discontented and almost timorous in his glance at the
      disenchanted face of his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like Grandpa Fedor, the Kalatch baker?&rdquo; asked Foma, having thought
      awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, like him. Only I am richer than he. I have more money than
      Fedor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you much money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, some people have still more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many barrels do you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of money, I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool! Is money counted by the barrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How else?&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, enthusiastically, and, turning his face toward
      his father, began to tell him quickly: &ldquo;Maksimka, the robber, came once to
      a certain town and filled up twelve barrels with money belonging to some
      rich man there. And he took different silverware and robbed a church. And
      cut up a man with his sword and threw him down the steeple because he
      tried to sound an alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your aunt tell you that?&rdquo; asked Ignat admiring his son&rsquo;s enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing!&rdquo; said Ignat, laughing. &ldquo;So you thought your father was a
      robber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And perhaps you were a robber long ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma again returned to his theme, and it was evident on his face that he
      would be very glad to hear an affirmative answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was never a robber. Let that end it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you I was not! What a queer little boy you are! Is it good to be a
      robber? They are all sinners, the robbers. They don&rsquo;t believe in God&mdash;they
      rob churches. They are all cursed in the churches. Yes. Look here, my son,
      you&rsquo;ll have to start to study soon. It is time; you&rsquo;ll soon be nine years
      old. Start with the help of God. You&rsquo;ll study during the winter and in
      spring I&rsquo;ll take you along with me on the Volga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will I go to school?&rdquo; asked Foma, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First you&rsquo;ll study at home with auntie.&rdquo; Soon after the boy would sit
      down near the table in the morning and, fingering the Slavonic alphabet,
      repeat after his aunt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Az, Buky, Vedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached &ldquo;bra, vra, gra, dra&rdquo; for a long time the boy could not
      read these syllables without laughter. Foma succeeded easily in gaining
      knowledge, almost without any effort, and soon he was reading the first
      psalm of the first section of the psalter: &ldquo;Blessed is the man that
      walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, my darling! So, Fomushka, that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; chimed in his aunt
      with emotion, enraptured by his progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine fellow, Foma!&rdquo; Ignat would approvingly say when informed of
      his son&rsquo;s progress. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go to Astrakhan for fish in the spring, and
      toward autumn I&rsquo;ll send you to school!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy&rsquo;s life rolled onward, like a ball downhill. Being his teacher, his
      aunt was his playmate as well. Luba Mayakin used to come, and when with
      them, the old woman readily became one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They played at &ldquo;hide and seek&rdquo; and &ldquo;blind man&rsquo;s buff;&rdquo; the children were
      pleased and amused at seeing Anfisa, her eyes covered with a handkerchief,
      her arms outstretched, walking about the room carefully, and yet striking
      against chairs and tables, or looking for them in each and every
      commodious corner, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, little rascals. Eh, rogues. Where have they hidden themselves? Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the sun shone cheerfully and playfully upon the old worn-out body,
      which yet retained a youthful soul, and upon the old life, that was
      adorning, according to its strength and abilities, the life-path of two
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignat used to go to the Exchange early in the morning and sometimes stayed
      away until evening; in the evening he used to go to the town council or
      visiting or elsewhere. Sometimes he returned home intoxicated. At first
      Foma, on such occasions, ran from him and hid himself, then he became
      accustomed to it, and learned that his father was better when drunk than
      sober: he was kinder and plainer and was somewhat comical. If it happened
      at night, the boy was usually awakened by his trumpet-like voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anfisa! Dear sister! Let me in to my son; let me in to my successor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And auntie answered him in a crying and reproachful voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on. You better go to sleep, you cursed devil! Drunk again, eh? You are
      gray already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anfisa! May I see my son, with one eye?&rdquo; Foma knew that Anfisa would not
      let him in, and he again fell asleep in spite of the noise of their
      voices. But when Ignat came home intoxicated during the day he immediately
      seized his son with his enormous paws and carried him about the rooms,
      asking him with an intoxicated, happy laughter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fomka! What do you wish? Speak! Presents? Playthings? Ask! Because you
      must know there&rsquo;s nothing in this world that I wouldn&rsquo;t buy for you. I
      have a million! Ha, ha, ha! And I&rsquo;ll have still more! Understand? All&rsquo;s
      yours! Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly his enthusiasm was extinguished like a candle put out by a
      violent puff of the wind. His flushed face began to shake, his eyes,
      burning red, filled with tears, and his lips expanded into a sad and
      frightened smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anfisa, in case he should die, what am I to do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And immediately after these words he was seized with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d burn everything!&rdquo; he roared, staring wildly into some dark corner of
      the room. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d destroy everything! I&rsquo;d blow it up with dynamite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, you ugly brute! Do you wish to frighten the child? Or do you want
      him to take sick?&rdquo; interposed Anfisa, and that was sufficient for Ignat to
      rush off hastily, muttering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well! I am going, I am going, but don&rsquo;t cry! Don&rsquo;t make any
      noise. Don&rsquo;t frighten him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when Foma was somewhat sick, his father, casting everything aside, did
      not leave the house for a moment, but bothered his sister and his son with
      stupid questions and advice; gloomy, sighing, and with fear in his eyes,
      he walked about the house quite out of sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you vex the Lord?&rdquo; said Anfisa. &ldquo;Beware, your grumblings will
      reach Him, and He will punish you for your complaints against His graces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, sister!&rdquo; sighed Ignat. &ldquo;And if it should happen? My entire life is
      crumbling away! Wherefore have I lived? No one knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Similar scenes and the striking transitions of his father from one mood to
      another frightened the child at first, but he soon became accustomed to
      all this, and when he noticed through the window that his father, on
      coming home, was hardly able to get out of the sledge, Foma said
      indifferently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie, papa came home drunk again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      .............................
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring came, and, fulfilling his promise, Ignat took his son along on one
      of his steamers, and here a new life, abounding in impressions, was opened
      before Foma&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful and mighty &ldquo;Yermak,&rdquo; Gordyeeff&rsquo;s steam tow-boat, was rapidly
      floating down the current, and on each side the shores of the powerful and
      beautiful Volga were slowly moving past him&mdash;the left side, all
      bathed in sunshine, stretching itself to the very end of the sky like a
      pompous carpet of verdure; the right shore, its high banks overgrown with
      woods, swung skyward, sinking in stern repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broad-bosomed river stretched itself majestically between the shores;
      noiselessly, solemnly and slowly flowed its waters, conscious of their
      invincible power; the mountainous shore is reflected in the water in a
      black shadow, while on the left side it is adorned with gold and with
      verdant velvet by a border of sand and the wide meadows. Here and there
      villages appear on mountain and on meadow, the sun shines bright on the
      window-panes of the huts and on the yellow roofs of straw, the church
      crosses sparkle amid the verdure of the trees, gray wind-mill wings
      revolve lazily in the air, smoke from the factory chimney rises skyward in
      thick, black curling clouds. Crowds of children in blue, red or white
      shirts, standing on the banks, shouted loudly at the sight of the steamer,
      which had disturbed the quiet of the river, and from under the steamer&rsquo;s
      wheels the cheerful waves are rushing toward the feet of the children and
      splash against the bank. Now a crowd of children, seated in a boat, rowed
      toward the middle of the river to rock there on the waves as in a cradle.
      Trees stood out above the water; sometimes many of them are drowned in the
      overflow of the banks, and these stand in the water like islands. From the
      shore a melancholy song is heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, o-o-o, once more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steamer passes many rafts, splashing them with waves. The beams are in
      continual motion under the blows of the waves; the men on the rafts in
      blue shirts, staggering, look at the steamer and laugh and shout
      something. The big, beautiful vessel goes sidewise on the river; the
      yellow scantlings with which it is loaded sparkle like gold and are dimly
      reflected in the muddy, vernal water. A passenger steamer comes from the
      opposite side and whistles&mdash;the resounding echo of the whistle loses
      itself in the woods, in the gorges of the mountainous bank, and dies away
      there. In the middle of the river the waves stirred up by the two vessels
      strike against one another and splash against the steamers&rsquo; sides, and the
      vessels are rocked upon the water. On the slope of the mountainous bank
      are verdant carpets of winter corn, brown strips of fallow ground and
      black strips of ground tilled for spring corn. Birds, like little dots,
      soar over them, and are clearly seen in the blue canopy of the sky; nearby
      a flock is grazing; in the distance they look like children&rsquo;s toys; the
      small figure of the shepherd stands leaning on a staff, and looks at the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glare of the water&mdash;freedom and liberty are everywhere, the
      meadows are cheerfully verdant and the blue sky is tenderly clear; a
      restrained power is felt in the quiet motion of the water; above it the
      generous May sun is shining, the air is filled with the exquisite odour of
      fir trees and of fresh foliage. And the banks keep on meeting them,
      caressing the eyes and the soul with their beauty, as new pictures
      constantly unfold themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything surrounding them bears the stamp of some kind of tardiness: all&mdash;nature
      as well as men&mdash;live there clumsily, lazily; but in that laziness
      there is an odd gracefulness, and it seems as though beyond the laziness a
      colossal power were concealed; an invincible power, but as yet deprived of
      consciousness, as yet without any definite desires and aims. And the
      absence of consciousness in this half-slumbering life throws shades of
      sadness over all the beautiful slope. Submissive patience, silent hope for
      something new and more inspiriting are heard even in the cry of the
      cuckoo, wafted to the river by the wind from the shore. The melancholy
      songs sound as though imploring someone for help. And at times there is in
      them a ring of despair. The river answers the songs with sighs. And the
      tree-tops shake, lost in meditation. Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma spent all day long on the captain&rsquo;s bridge beside his father. Without
      uttering a word, he stared wide-eyed at the endless panorama of the banks,
      and it seemed to him he was moving along a broad silver path in those
      wonderful kingdoms inhabited by the sorcerers and giants of his familiar
      fairy-tales. At times he would load his father with questions about
      everything that passed before them. Ignat answered him willingly and
      concisely, but the boy was not pleased with his answers; they contained
      nothing interesting and intelligible to him, and he did not hear what he
      longed to hear. Once he told his father with a sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie Anfisa knows better than you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does she know?&rdquo; asked Ignat, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; replied the boy, convincedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonderful kingdom appeared before him. But often cities appeared on the
      banks of the river, just such cities as the one where Foma lived. Some of
      them were larger, some smaller, but the people, and the houses, and the
      churches&mdash;all were the same as in his own city. Foma examined them in
      company with his father, but was still unsatisfied and returned to the
      steamer gloomy and fatigued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow we shall be in Astrakhan,&rdquo; said Ignat one day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it just the same as the other cities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. How else should it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is beyond Astrakhan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sea. The Caspian Sea it is called.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fishes, queer fellow! What else can there be in the water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the city Kitezh standing in the water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a different thing! That&rsquo;s Kitezh. Only righteous people live
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are there no righteous cities on the sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ignat, and, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, added: &ldquo;The sea water is
      bitter and nobody can drink it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is there more land beyond the sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, the sea must have an end. It is like a cup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are there cities there too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again cities. Of course! Only that land is not ours, it belongs to
      Persia. Did you see the Persians selling pistachio-nuts and apricots in
      the market?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw them,&rdquo; replied Foma, and became pensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he asked his father:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there much more land left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The earth is very big, my dear! If you should go on foot, you couldn&rsquo;t go
      around it even in ten years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ignat talked for a long time with his son about the size of the earth, and
      said at length:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet no one knows for certain how big it really is, nor where it
      ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is everything alike on earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The cities and all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, the cities are like cities. There are houses, streets&mdash;and
      everything that is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After many similar conversations the boy no longer stared so often into
      the distance with the interrogative look of his black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crew of the steamer loved him, and he, too, loved those fine,
      sun-burnt and weather-beaten fellows, who laughingly played with him. They
      made fishing tackles for him, and little boats out of bark, played with
      him and rowed him about the anchoring place, when Ignat went to town on
      business. The boy often heard the men talking about his father, but he
      paid no attention to what they said, and never told his father what he
      heard about him. But one day, in Astrakhan, while the steamer was taking
      in a cargo of fuel, Foma heard the voice of Petrovich, the machinist:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ordered such a lot of wood to be taken in. What an absurd man! First
      he loads the steamer up to the very deck, and then he roars. &lsquo;You break
      the machinery too often,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;You pour oil,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;at random.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the gray and stern pilot replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all his exorbitant greediness. Fuel is cheaper here, so he is taking
      all he can. He is greedy, the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how greedy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This word, repeated many times in succession, fixed itself in Foma&rsquo;s
      memory, and in the evening, at supper, he suddenly asked his father:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you greedy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In reply to his father&rsquo;s questions Foma told him of the conversation
      between the pilot and the machinist. Ignat&rsquo;s face became gloomy, and his
      eyes began to flash angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it is,&rdquo; ejaculated Ignat, shaking his head. &ldquo;Well, you&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      you listen to them. They are not your equals; don&rsquo;t have so much to do
      with them. You are their master, they are your servants, understand that.
      If we choose to, we can put every one of them ashore. They are cheap and
      they can be found everywhere like dogs. Understand? They may say many bad
      things about me. But they say them, because I am their master. The whole
      thing arises because I am fortunate and rich, and the rich are always
      envied. A happy man is everybody&rsquo;s enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About two days later there was a new pilot and another machinist on the
      steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is Yakov?&rdquo; asked the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I discharged him. I ordered him away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For that?&rdquo; queried Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for that very thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Petrovich, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I sent him the same way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma was pleased with the fact that his father was able to change the men
      so quickly. He smiled to his father, and, coming out on the deck, walked
      up to a sailor, who sat on the floor, untwisting a piece of rope and
      making a swab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a new pilot here,&rdquo; announced Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. Good health to you, Foma Ignatich! How did you sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a new machinist, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a new machinist. Are you sorry for Petrovich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? And he was so good to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why did he abuse my father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? Did he abuse him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he did. I heard it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm&mdash;and your father heard it, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I told him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;so&rdquo;&mdash;drawled the sailor and became silent, taking up his
      work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And papa says to me: &lsquo;You,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;you are master here&mdash;you can
      drive them all away if you wish.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said the sailor, gloomily looking at the boy, who was so
      enthusiastically boasting to him of his supreme power. From that day on
      Foma noticed that the crew did not regard him as before. Some became more
      obliging and kind, others did not care to speak to him, and when they did
      speak to him, it was done angrily, and not at all entertainingly, as
      before. Foma liked to watch while the deck was being washed: their
      trousers rolled up to their knees, or sometimes taken off altogether, the
      sailors, with swabs and brushes in their hands, cleverly ran about the
      deck, emptying pails of water on it, besprinkling one another, laughing,
      shouting, falling. Streams of water ran in every direction, and the lively
      noise of the men intermingled with the gray splash of the water. Before,
      the boy never bothered the sailors in this playful and light work; nay, he
      took an active part, besprinkling them with water and laughingly running
      away, when they threatened to pour water over him. But after Yakov and
      Petrovich had been discharged, he felt that he was in everybody&rsquo;s way,
      that no one cared to play with him and that no one regarded him kindly.
      Surprised and melancholy, he left the deck, walked up to the wheel, sat
      down there, and, offended, he thoughtfully began to stare at the distant
      green bank and the dented strip of woods upon it. And below, on the deck,
      the water was splashing playfully, and the sailors were gaily laughing. He
      yearned to go down to them, but something held him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep away from them as much as possible,&rdquo; he recalled his father&rsquo;s words;
      &ldquo;you are their master.&rdquo; Then he felt like shouting at the sailors&mdash;something
      harsh and authoritative, so his father would scold them. He thought a long
      time what to say, but could not think of anything. Another two, three days
      passed, and it became perfectly clear to him that the crew no longer liked
      him. He began to feel lonesome on the steamer, and amid the parti-coloured
      mist of new impressions, still more often there came up before Foma the
      image of his kind and gentle Aunt Anfisa, with her stories, and smiles,
      and soft, ringing laughter, which filled the boy&rsquo;s soul with a joyous
      warmth. He still lived in the world of fairy-tales, but the invisible and
      pitiless hand of reality was already at work tearing the beautiful, fine
      web of the wonderful, through which the boy had looked at everything about
      him. The incident with the machinist and the pilot directed his attention
      to his surroundings; Foma&rsquo;s eyes became more sharp-sighted. A conscious
      searchfulness appeared in them and in his questions to his father rang a
      yearning to understand which threads and springs were managing the deeds
      of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a scene took place before him: the sailors were carrying wood, and
      one of them, the young, curly-haired and gay Yefim, passing the deck of
      the ship with hand-barrows, said loudly and angrily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he has no conscience whatever! There was no agreement that I should
      carry wood. A sailor&mdash;well, one&rsquo;s business is clear&mdash;but to
      carry wood into the bargain&mdash;thank you! That means for me to take off
      the skin I have not sold. He is without conscience! He thinks it is clever
      to sap the life out of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy heard this grumbling and knew that it was concerning his father.
      He also noticed that although Yefim was grumbling, he carried more wood on
      his stretcher than the others, and walked faster than the others. None of
      the sailors replied to Yefim&rsquo;s grumbling, and even the one who worked with
      him was silent, only now and then protesting against the earnestness with
      which Yefim piled up the wood on the stretchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; he would say, morosely, &ldquo;you are not loading a horse, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you had better keep quiet. You were put to the cart&mdash;cart it and
      don&rsquo;t kick&mdash;and should your blood be sucked&mdash;keep quiet again.
      What can you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Ignat appeared, walked up to the sailor and, stopping in front of
      him, asked sternly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am talking&mdash;I know,&rdquo; replied Yefim, hesitating. &ldquo;There was no
      agreement&mdash;that I must say nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is going to suck blood?&rdquo; asked Ignat, stroking his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sailor understood that he had been caught unawares, and seeing no way
      out of it, he let the log of wood fall from his hands, rubbed his palms
      against his pants, and, facing Ignat squarely, said rather boldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And am I not right? Don&rsquo;t you suck it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma saw that his father swung his hand. A loud blow resounded, and the
      sailor fell heavily on the wood. He arose immediately and worked on in
      silence. Blood was trickling from his bruised face on to the white bark of
      the birch wood; he wiped the blood off his face with the sleeve of his
      shirt, looked at his sleeve and, heaving a sigh, maintained silence, and
      when he went past Foma with the hand-harrows, two big, turbid tears were
      trembling on his face, near the bridge of his nose, and Foma noticed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner Foma was pensive and now and then glanced at his father with
      fear in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you frown?&rdquo; asked his father, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill, perhaps? Be careful. If there is anything, tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are strong,&rdquo; said Foma of a sudden musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? That&rsquo;s right. God has favoured me with strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How hard you struck him!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy in a low voice, lowering his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignat was about to put a piece of bread with caviar into his mouth, but
      his hand stopped, held back by his son&rsquo;s exclamation; he looked
      interrogatively at Foma&rsquo;s drooping head and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Yefim, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was bleeding. And how he walked afterward, how he cried,&rdquo; said
      the boy in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; roared Ignat, chewing a bite. &ldquo;Well, are you sorry for him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity!&rdquo; said Foma, with tears in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. So that&rsquo;s the kind of a fellow you are,&rdquo; said Ignat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, he filled a wineglass with vodka, emptied
      it, and said sternly, in a slightly reprimanding tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no reason why you should pity him. He brawled at random, and
      therefore got what he deserved. I know him: he is a good fellow,
      industrious, strong and not a bit foolish. But to argue is not his
      business; I may argue, because I am the master. It isn&rsquo;t simple to be
      master. A punch wouldn&rsquo;t kill him, but will make him wiser. That&rsquo;s the
      way. Eh, Foma! You are an infant, and you do not understand these things.
      I must teach you how to live. It may be that my days on earth are
      numbered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ignat was silent for awhile, drank some more vodka and went on
      instinctively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is necessary to have pity on men. You are right in doing so. But you
      must pity them sensibly. First look at a man, find out what good there is
      in him, and what use may be made of him! And if you find him to be strong
      and capable&mdash;pity and assist him. And if he is weak and not inclined
      to work&mdash;spit upon him, pass him by. Just keep this in mind&mdash;the
      man who complains against everything, who sighs and moans all the time&mdash;that
      man is worth nothing; he merits no compassion and you will do him no good
      whatever, even if you help him. Pity for such people makes them more
      morose, spoils them the more. In your godfather&rsquo;s house you saw various
      kinds of people&mdash;unfortunate travellers and hangers-on, and all sorts
      of rabble. Forget them. They are not men, they are just shells, and are
      good for nothing. They are like bugs, fleas and other unclean things. Nor
      do they live for God&rsquo;s sake&mdash;they have no God. They call His name in
      vain, in order to move fools to pity, and, thus pitied, to fill their
      bellies with something. They live but for their bellies, and aside from
      eating, drinking, sleeping and moaning they can do nothing. And all they
      accomplish is the soul&rsquo;s decay. They are in your way and you trip over
      them. A good man among them&mdash;like fresh apples among bad ones&mdash;may
      soon be spoilt, and no one will profit by it. You are young, that&rsquo;s the
      trouble. You cannot comprehend my words. Help him who is firm in misery.
      He may not ask you for assistance, but think of it yourself, and assist
      him without his request. And if he should happen to be proud and thus feel
      offended at your aid, do not allow him to see that you are lending him a
      helping hand. That&rsquo;s the way it should be done, according to common sense!
      Here, for example, two boards, let us say, fall into the mud&mdash;one of
      them is a rotten one, the other, a good sound board. What should you do?
      What good is there in the rotten board? You had better drop it, let it
      stay in the mud and step on it so as not to soil your feet. As to the
      sound board, lift it up and place it in the sun; if it can be of no use to
      you, someone else may avail himself of it. That&rsquo;s the way it is, my son!
      Listen to me and remember. There is no reason why Yefim should be pitied.
      He is a capable fellow, he knows his value. You cannot knock his soul out
      with a box on the ear. I&rsquo;ll just watch him for about a week, and then I&rsquo;ll
      put him at the helm. And there, I am quite sure, he&rsquo;ll be a good pilot.
      And if he should be promoted to captain, he wouldn&rsquo;t lose courage&mdash;he
      would make a clever captain! That&rsquo;s the way people grow. I have gone
      through this school myself, dear. I, too, received more than one box on
      the ear when I was of his age. Life, my son, is not a dear mother to all
      of us. It is our exacting mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ignat talked with his son about two hours, telling him of his own youth,
      of his toils, of men; their terrible power, and of their weakness; of how
      they live, and sometimes pretend to be unfortunate in order to live on
      other people&rsquo;s money; and then he told him of himself, and of how he rose
      from a plain working man to be proprietor of a large concern. The boy
      listened to his words, looked at him and felt as though his father were
      coming nearer and nearer to him. And though his father&rsquo;s story did not
      contain the material of which Aunt Anfisa&rsquo;s fairy-tales were brimful,
      there was something new in it, something clearer and more comprehensible
      than in her fairy-tales, and something just as interesting. Something
      powerful and warm began to throb within his little heart, and he was drawn
      toward his father. Ignat, evidently, surmised his son&rsquo;s feelings by his
      eyes: he rose abruptly from his seat, seized him in his arms and pressed
      him firmly to his breast. And Foma embraced his neck, and, pressing his
      cheek to that of his father, was silent and breathed rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; whispered Ignat in a dull voice, &ldquo;My darling! My joy! Learn
      while I am alive. Alas! it is hard to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child&rsquo;s heart trembled at this whisper; he set his teeth together, and
      hot tears gushed from his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until this day Ignat had never kindled any particular feeling in his son:
      the boy was used to him; he was tired of looking at his enormous figure,
      and feared him slightly, but was at the same time aware that his father
      would do anything for him that he wanted. Sometimes Ignat would stay away
      from home a day, two, a week, or possibly the entire summer. And yet Foma
      did not even notice his absence, so absorbed was he by his love for Aunt
      Anfisa. When Ignat returned the boy was glad, but he could hardly tell
      whether it was his father&rsquo;s arrival that gladdened him or the playthings
      he brought with him. But now, at the sight of Ignat, the boy ran to meet
      him, grasped him by the hand, laughed, stared into his eyes and felt weary
      if he did not see him for two or three hours: His father became
      interesting to him, and, rousing his curiosity, he fairly developed love
      and respect for himself. Every time that they were together Foma begged
      his father:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, tell me about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      .........................
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer was now going up the Volga. One suffocating night in July,
      when the sky was overcast with thick black clouds, and everything on the
      Volga was somewhat ominously calm, they reached Kazan and anchored near
      Uslon at the end of an enormous fleet of vessels. The clinking of the
      anchor chains and the shouting of the crew awakened Foma; he looked out of
      the window and saw, far in the distance, small lights glimmering
      fantastically: the water about the boat black and thick, like oil&mdash;and
      nothing else could be seen. The boy&rsquo;s heart trembled painfully and he
      began to listen attentively. A scarcely audible, melancholy song reached
      his ears&mdash;mournful and monotonous as a chant on the caravan the
      watchmen called to one another; the steamer hissed angrily getting up
      steam. And the black water of the river splashed sadly and quietly against
      the sides of the vessels. Staring fixedly into the darkness, until his
      eyes hurt, the boy discerned black piles and small lights dimly burning
      high above them. He knew that those were barges, but this knowledge did
      not calm him and his heart throbbed unevenly, and, in his imagination,
      terrifying dark images arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-o-o,&rdquo; a drawling cry came from the distance and ended like a wail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone crossed the deck and went up to the side of the steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-o-o,&rdquo; was heard again, but nearer this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yefim!&rdquo; some one called in a low voice on the deck. &ldquo;Yefimka!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil! Get up! Take the boat-hook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O-o-o,&rdquo; someone moaned near by, and Foma, shuddering, stepped back from
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queer sound came nearer and nearer and grew in strength, sobbed and
      died out in the darkness. While on the deck they whispered with alarm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yefimka! Get up! A guest is floating!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; came a hasty question, then bare feet began to patter about the
      deck, a bustle was heard, and two boat-hooks slipped down past the boy&rsquo;s
      face and almost noiselessly plunged into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gue-e-est!&rdquo; Some began to sob near by, and a quiet, but very queer
      splash resounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy trembled with fright at this mournful cry, but he could not tear
      his hands from the window nor his eyes from the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light the lantern. You can&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then a spot of dim light fell over the water. Foma saw that the water
      was rocking calmly, that a ripple was passing over it, as though the water
      were afflicted, and trembled for pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! Look!&rdquo; they whispered on the deck with fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time a big, terrible human face, with white teeth set
      together, appeared on the spot of light. It floated and rocked in the
      water, its teeth seemed to stare at Foma as though saying, with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, boy, boy, it is cold. Goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat-hooks shook, were lifted in the air, were lowered again into the
      water and carefully began to push something there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shove him! Shove! Look out, he may be thrown under the wheel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shove him yourself then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat-hooks glided over the side of the steamer, and, scratching
      against it, produced a noise like the grinding of teeth. Foma could not
      close his eyes for watching them. The noise of feet stamping on the deck,
      over his head, was gradually moving toward the stern. And then again that
      moaning cry for the dead was heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gue-e-est!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; cried Foma in a ringing voice. &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; His father jumped to his
      feet and rushed toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that? What are they doing there?&rdquo; cried Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wildly roaring, Ignat jumped out of the cabin with huge bounds. He soon
      returned, sooner than Foma, staggering and looking around him, had time to
      reach his father&rsquo;s bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They frightened you? It&rsquo;s nothing!&rdquo; said Ignat, taking him up in his
      arms. &ldquo;Lie down with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Foma, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was nothing, my son. Only a drowned man. A man was drowned and he is
      floating. That&rsquo;s nothing! Don&rsquo;t be afraid, he has already floated clear of
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did they push him?&rdquo; interrogated the boy, firmly pressing close to
      his father, and shutting his eyes for fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was necessary to do so. The water might have thrown him under the
      wheel. Under ours, for instance. Tomorrow the police would notice it,
      there would be trouble, inquests, and we would be held here for
      examination. That&rsquo;s why we shoved him along. What difference does it make
      to him? He is dead; it doesn&rsquo;t pain him; it doesn&rsquo;t offend him. And the
      living would be troubled on his account. Sleep, my son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he will float on that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will float. They&rsquo;ll take him out somewhere and bury him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will a fish devour him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fish do not eat human bodies. Crabs eat them. They like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma&rsquo;s fright was melting, from the heat of his father&rsquo;s body, but before
      his eyes the terrible sneering face was still rocking in the black water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows! Say to God about him: &lsquo;Oh Lord, rest his soul! &lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, rest his soul!&rdquo; repeated Foma, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Sleep now, don&rsquo;t fear. He is far away now! Floating on. See
      here, be careful as you go up to the side of the ship. You may fall
      overboard. God forbid! And&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he fall overboard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. Perhaps he was drunk, and that&rsquo;s his end! And maybe he threw
      himself into the water. There are people who do that. They go and throw
      themselves into the water and are drowned. Life, my dear, is so arranged
      that death is sometimes a holiday for one, sometimes it is a blessing for
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep, sleep, dear.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      DURING the very first day of his school life, stupefied by the lively and
      hearty noise of provoking mischiefs and of wild, childish games, Foma
      picked out two boys from the crowd who at once seemed more interesting to
      him than the others. One had a seat in front of him. Foma, looking
      askance, saw a broad back; a full neck, covered with freckles; big ears;
      and the back of the head closely cropped, covered with light-red hair
      which stood out like bristles.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the teacher, a bald-headed man, whose lower lip hung down, called
      out: &ldquo;Smolin, African!&rdquo; the red-headed boy arose slowly, walked up to the
      teacher, calmly stared into his face, and, having listened to the problem,
      carefully began to make big round figures on the blackboard with chalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good enough!&rdquo; said the teacher. &ldquo;Yozhov, Nicolai. Proceed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One of Foma&rsquo;s neighbours, a fidgety little boy with black little
      mouse-eyes, jumped up from his seat and passed through the aisle, striking
      against everything and turning his head on all sides. At the blackboard he
      seized the chalk, and, standing up on the toes of his boots, noisily began
      to mark the board with the chalk, creaking and filling with chalk dust,
      dashing off small, illegible marks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so loud!&rdquo; said the teacher, wrinkling his yellow face and contracting
      his fatigued eyes. Yozhov spoke quickly and in a ringing voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we know that the first peddler made 17k. profit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! Gordyeeff! Tell me what must we do in order to find out how much
      the second peddler gained?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Watching the conduct of the boys, so unlike each other, Foma was thus
      taken unawares by the question and he kept quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? How? Explain it to him, Smolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having carefully wiped his fingers, which had been soiled with chalk,
      Smolin put the rag away, and, without looking at Foma, finished the
      problem and again began to wipe his hands, while Yozhov, smiling and
      skipping along as he walked, returned to his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you!&rdquo; he whispered, seating himself beside Foma, incidentally
      striking his side with his fist. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you know it? What was the
      profit altogether? Thirty kopecks. And there were two peddlers. One of
      them got 17. Well, how much did the other one get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; replied Foma, in a whisper, feeling confused and examining the
      face of Smolin, who was sedately returning to his seat. He didn&rsquo;t like
      that round, freckled face, with the blue eyes, which were loaded with fat.
      And Yozhov pinched his leg and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose son are you? The Frantic&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So. Do you wish me to prompt you always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what will you give me for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma thought awhile and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know it all yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I am the best pupil. You&rsquo;ll see for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, there! Yozhov, you are talking again?&rdquo; cried the teacher, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov jumped to his feet and said boldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not I, Ivan Andreyich&mdash;it&rsquo;s Gordyeeff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of them were whispering,&rdquo; announced Smolin, serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wrinkling his face mournfully and moving his big lip comically, the
      teacher reprimanded them all, but his words did not prevent Yozhov from
      whispering immediately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Smolin! I&rsquo;ll remember you for telling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why do you blame it all on the new boy?&rdquo; asked Smolin, in a low
      voice, without even turning his head to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; hissed Yozhov.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma was silent, looking askance at his brisk neighbour, who at once
      pleased him and roused in him a desire to get as far as possible away from
      him. During recess he learned from Yozhov that Smolin, too, was rich,
      being the son of a tan-yard proprietor, and that Yozhov himself was the
      son of a guard at the Court of Exchequer, and very poor. The last was
      clearly evident by the adroit boy&rsquo;s costume, made of gray fustian and
      adorned with patches on the knees and elbows; by his pale, hungry-looking
      face; and, by his small, angular and bony figure. This boy spoke in a
      metallic alto, elucidating his words with grimaces and gesticulations, and
      he often used words whose meaning was known but to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be friends,&rdquo; he announced to Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you complain to the teacher about me?&rdquo; Gordyeeff reminded Yozhov,
      looking at him suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! What&rsquo;s the difference to you? You are a new scholar and rich. The
      teacher is not exacting with the rich. And I am a poor hanger-on; he
      doesn&rsquo;t like me, because I am impudent and because I never bring him any
      presents. If I had been a bad pupil he would have expelled me long ago.
      You know I&rsquo;ll go to the Gymnasium from here. I&rsquo;ll pass the second class
      and then I&rsquo;ll leave. Already a student is preparing me for the second
      class. There I&rsquo;ll study so that they can&rsquo;t hold me back! How many horses
      do you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three. What do you need to study so much for?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am poor. The poor must study hard so that they may become rich.
      They become doctors, functionaries, officers. I shall be a &lsquo;tinkler.&rsquo; A
      sword at my side, spur on my boots. Cling, cling! And what are you going
      to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Foma, pensively, examining his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not be anything. And are you fond of pigeons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a good-for-nothing you are! Oh! Eh!&rdquo; Yozhov imitated Foma&rsquo;s slow way
      of speaking. &ldquo;How many pigeons do you have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you! Rich, and yet you have no pigeons. Even I have three. If my
      father had been rich I would have had a hundred pigeons and chased them
      all day long. Smolin has pigeons, too, fine ones! Fourteen. He made me a
      present of one. Only, he is greedy. All the rich are greedy. And you, are
      you greedy, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Foma, irresolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up to Smolin&rsquo;s and the three of us together will chase the pigeons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. If they let me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, does not your father like you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, he&rsquo;ll let you go. Only don&rsquo;t tell him that I am coming.
      Perhaps he would not let you go with me. Tell him you want to go to
      Smolin&rsquo;s. Smolin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A plump boy came up to them, and Yozhov accosted him, shaking his head
      reproachfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you red-headed slanderer! It isn&rsquo;t worth while to be friends with
      you, blockhead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you abuse me?&rdquo; asked Smolin, calmly, examining Foma fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not abusing you; I am telling the truth,&rdquo; Yozhov explained,
      straightening himself with animation. &ldquo;Listen! Although you are a kissel,
      but&mdash;let it go! We&rsquo;ll come up to see you on Sunday after mass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; Smolin nodded his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come up. They&rsquo;ll ring the bell soon. I must run to sell the
      siskin,&rdquo; declared Yozhov, pulling out of his pocket a paper package,
      wherein some live thing was struggling. And he disappeared from the
      school-yard as mercury from the palm of a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a queer fellow he is!&rdquo; said Foma, dumfounded by Yozhov&rsquo;s adroitness
      and looking at Smolin interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is always like this. He&rsquo;s very clever,&rdquo; the red-headed boy explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And cheerful, too,&rdquo; added Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheerful, too,&rdquo; Smolin assented. Then they became silent, looking at each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come up with him to my house?&rdquo; asked the red-headed boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up. It&rsquo;s nice there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma said nothing to this. Then Smolin asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you many friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither did I have any friends before I went to school. Only cousins. Now
      you&rsquo;ll have two friends at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you glad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have lots of friends, it is lively. And it is easier to study,
      too&mdash;they prompt you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you a good pupil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! I do everything well,&rdquo; said Smolin, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell began to bang as though it had been frightened and was hastily
      running somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting in school, Foma began to feel somewhat freer, and compared his
      friends with the rest of the boys. He soon learned that they both were the
      very best boys in school and that they were the first to attract
      everybody&rsquo;s attention, even as the two figures 5 and 7, which had not yet
      been wiped off the blackboard. And Foma felt very much pleased that his
      friends were better than any of the other boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all went home from school together, but Yozhov soon turned into some
      narrow side street, while Smolin walked with Foma up to his very house,
      and, departing, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, we both go home the same way, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At home Foma was met with pomp: his father made him a present of a heavy
      silver spoon, with an ingenious monogram on it, and his aunt gave him a
      scarf knitted by herself. They were awaiting him for dinner, having
      prepared his favourite dishes for him, and as soon as he took off his
      coat, seated him at the table and began to ply him with questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how was it? How did you like the school?&rdquo; asked Ignat, looking
      lovingly at his son&rsquo;s rosy, animated face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty good. It&rsquo;s nice!&rdquo; replied Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling!&rdquo; sighed his aunt, with feeling, &ldquo;look out, hold your own with
      your friends. As soon as they offend you tell your teachers about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on. What else will you tell him?&rdquo; Ignat smiled. &ldquo;Never do that! Try to
      get square with every offender yourself, punish him with your own hand,
      not with somebody else&rsquo;s. Are there any good fellows there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two,&rdquo; Foma smiled, recalling Yozhov. &ldquo;One of them is so bold&mdash;terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A guard&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm! Bold did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadfully bold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let him be! And the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other one is red-headed. Smolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Evidently Mitry Ivanovitch&rsquo;s son. Stick to him, he&rsquo;s good company.
      Mitry is a clever peasant. If the son takes after his father it is all
      right. But that other one&mdash;you know, Foma, you had better invite them
      to our house on Sunday. I&rsquo;ll buy some presents and you can treat them.
      We&rsquo;ll see what sort of boys they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smolin asked me to come to him this Sunday,&rdquo; said Foma, looking up at his
      father questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So. Well, you may go! That&rsquo;s all right, go. Observe what kind of people
      there are in the world. You cannot pass your life alone, without
      friendship. Your godfather and I, for instance, have been friends for more
      than twenty years, and I have profited a great deal by his common sense.
      So you, too, try to be friendly with those that are better and wiser than
      you. Rub against a good man, like a copper coin against silver, and you
      may then pass for a silver coin yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, bursting into laughter at his comparison, Ignat added seriously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only jesting. Try to be, not artificial, but genuine. And have some
      common sense, no matter how little, but your own. Have you many lessons to
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many!&rdquo; sighed the boy, and to his sigh, like an echo, his aunt answered
      with a heavy sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, study. Don&rsquo;t be worse than others at school. Although, I&rsquo;ll tell
      you, even if there were twenty-five classes in your school, they could
      never teach you there anything save reading, writing and arithmetic. You
      may also learn some naughty things, but God protect you! I shall give you
      a terrible spanking if you do. If you smoke tobacco I&rsquo;ll cut your lips
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember God, Fomushka,&rdquo; said the aunt. &ldquo;See that you don&rsquo;t forget our
      Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true! Honour God and your father. But I wish to tell you that
      school books are but a trivial matter. You need these as a carpenter needs
      an adze and a pointer. They are tools, but the tools cannot teach you how
      to make use of them. Understand? Let us see: Suppose an adze were handed
      to a carpenter for him to square a beam with it. It&rsquo;s not enough to have
      hands and an adze; it is also necessary for him to know how to strike the
      wood so as not to hit his foot instead. To you the knowledge of reading
      and writing is given, and you must regulate your life with it. Thus it
      follows that books alone are but a trifle in this matter; it is necessary
      to be able to take advantage of them. And it is this ability that is more
      cunning than any books, and yet nothing about it is written in the books.
      This, Foma, you must learn from Life itself. A book is a dead thing, you
      may take it as you please, you may tear it, break it&mdash;it will not cry
      out. While should you but make a single wrong step in life, or wrongly
      occupy a place in it, Life will start to bawl at you in a thousand voices;
      it will deal you a blow, felling you to the ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma, his elbows leaning on the table, attentively listened to his father,
      and under the sound of his powerful voice he pictured to himself now the
      carpenter squaring a beam, now himself, his hands outstretched, carefully
      and stealthily approaching some colossal and living thing, and desiring to
      grasp that terrible something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man must preserve himself for his work and must be thoroughly
      acquainted with the road to it. A man, dear, is like the pilot on a ship.
      In youth, as at high tide, go straight! A way is open to you everywhere.
      But you must know when it is time to steer. The waters recede&mdash;here
      you see a sandbank, there, a rock; it is necessary to know all this and to
      slip off in time, in order to reach the harbour safe and sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will reach it!&rdquo; said the boy, looking at his father proudly and with
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? You speak courageously!&rdquo; Ignat burst into laughter. And the aunt also
      began to laugh kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since his trip with his father on the Volga, Foma became more lively and
      talkative at home, with his father, with his aunt and with Mayakin. But on
      the street, in a new place, or in the presence of strangers, he was always
      gloomy, always looking about him with suspicion, as though he felt
      something hostile to him everywhere, something hidden from him spying on
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nights he sometimes awoke of a sudden and listened for a long time to
      the silence about him, fixedly staring into the dark with wide-open eyes.
      And then his father&rsquo;s stories were transformed before him into images and
      pictures. Without being aware of it, he mixed up those stories with his
      aunt&rsquo;s fairy-tales, thus creating for himself a chaos of adventures
      wherein the bright colours of fantasy were whimsically intertwined with
      the stern shades of reality. This resulted in something colossal,
      incomprehensible; the boy closed his eyes and drove it all away from him
      and tried to check the play of his imagination, which frightened him. In
      vain he attempted to fall asleep, and the chamber became more and more
      crowded with dark images. Then he quietly roused his aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie! Auntie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Christ be with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come to you,&rdquo; whispered Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Sleep, darling, sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; confessed the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You better say to yourself, &lsquo;And the Lord will rise again,&rsquo; then you
      won&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma lies with his eyes open and says the prayer. The silence of the night
      pictures itself before him in the form of an endless expanse of perfectly
      calm, dark water, which has overflowed everything and congealed; there is
      not a ripple on it, not a shadow of a motion, and neither is there
      anything within it, although it is bottomlessly deep. It is very terrible
      for one to look down from the dark at this dead water. But now the sound
      of the night watchman&rsquo;s mallet is heard, and the boy sees that the surface
      of the water is beginning to tremble, and, covering the surface with
      ripples, light little balls are dancing upon it. The sound of the bell on
      the steeple, with one mighty swing, brings all the water in agitation and
      it is slightly trembling from that sound; a big spot of light is also
      trembling, spreading light upon the water, radiating from its centre into
      the dark distance, there growing paler and dying out. Again there is weary
      and deathlike repose in this dark desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie,&rdquo; whispers Foma, beseechingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then, come, my darling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Going over into auntie&rsquo;s bed, he presses close to her, begging:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At night?&rdquo; protests auntie, sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He does not have to ask her long. Yawning, her eyes closed, the old woman
      begins slowly in a voice grown heavy with sleep:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear sir, in a certain kingdom, in a certain empire, there lived
      a man and his wife, and they were very poor. They were so unfortunate that
      they had nothing to eat. They would go around begging, somebody would give
      them a crust of stale bread and that would keep them for awhile. And it
      came to pass that the wife begot a child&mdash;a child was born&mdash;it
      was necessary to christen it, but, being poor, they could not entertain
      the godparents and the guests, so nobody came to christen the child. They
      tried this and they tried that&mdash;yet nobody came. And they began to
      pray to the Lord, &lsquo;Oh Lord! Oh Lord!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma knew this awful story about God&rsquo;s godchild. He had heard it more than
      once and was already picturing to himself this godchild riding on a white
      horse to his godfather and godmother; he was riding in the darkness, over
      the desert, and he saw there all the unbearable miseries to which sinners
      are condemned. And he heard their faint moans and requests:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Man! Ask the Lord yet how long are we to suffer here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then it appeared to Foma that it was he who was riding at night on the
      white horse, and that the moans and the implorings were addressed to him.
      His heart contracts with some incomprehensible desire; sorrow compressed
      his breast and tears gathered in his eyes, which he had firmly closed and
      now feared to open.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is tossing about in his bed restlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sleep, my child. Christ be with you!&rdquo; says the old woman, interrupting
      her tale of men suffering for their sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the morning after such a night Foma rose sound and cheerful, washed
      himself hastily, drank his tea in haste and ran off to school, provided
      with sweet cakes, which were awaited by the always hungry little Yozhov,
      who greedily subsisted on his rich friend&rsquo;s generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got anything to eat?&rdquo; he accosted Foma, turning up his sharp-pointed
      nose. &ldquo;Let me have it, for I left the house without eating anything. I
      slept too long, devil take it! I studied up to two o&rsquo;clock last night.
      Have you solved your problems?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you lazy bones! Well, I&rsquo;ll dash them off for you directly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Driving his small, thin teeth into the cakes, he purred something like a
      kitten, stamped his left foot, beating time, and at the same time solved
      the problem, rattling off short phrases to Foma:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See? Eight bucketfuls leaked out in one hour. And how many hours did it
      leak&mdash;six? Eh, what good things they eat in your house! Consequently,
      we must multiply six by eight. Do you like cake with green onions? Oh, how
      I like it! So that in six hours forty-eight bucketfuls leaked out of the
      first gauge-cock. And altogether the tub contained ninety. Do you
      understand the rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma liked Yozhov better than Smolin, but he was more friendly with
      Smolin. He wondered at the ability and the sprightliness of the little
      fellow. He saw that Yozhov was more clever and better than himself; he
      envied him, and felt offended on that account, and at the same time he
      pitied him with the condescending compassion of a satisfied man for a
      hungry one. Perhaps it was this very compassion that prevented him from
      preferring this bright boy to the boring red-headed Smolin. Yozhov, fond
      of having a laugh at the expense of his well-fed friends, told them quite
      often: &ldquo;Eh, you are little trunks full of cakes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma was angry with him for his sneers, and one day, touched to the quick,
      said wickedly and with contempt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are a beggar&mdash;a pauper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov&rsquo;s yellow face became overcast, and he replied slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, so be it! I shall never prompt you again&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll be
      like a log of wood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they did not speak to each other for about three days, very much to
      the regret of the teacher, who during these days had to give the lowest
      markings to the son of the esteemed Ignat Matveyich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov knew everything: he related at school how the procurator&rsquo;s
      chambermaid gave birth to a child, and that for this the procurator&rsquo;s wife
      poured hot coffee over her husband; he could tell where and when it was
      best to catch perch; he knew how to make traps and cages for birds; he
      could give a detailed account of how the soldier had hanged himself in the
      garret of the armoury, and knew from which of the pupils&rsquo; parents the
      teacher had received a present that day and precisely what sort of a
      present it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sphere of Smolin&rsquo;s knowledge and interests was confined to the
      merchant&rsquo;s mode of life, and, above all, the red-headed boy was fond of
      judging whether this man was richer than that, valuing and pricing their
      houses, their vessels and their horses. All this he knew to perfection,
      and spoke of it with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like Foma, he regarded Yozhov with the same condescending pity, but more
      as a friend and equal. Whenever Gordyeeff quarrelled with Yozhov, Smolin
      hastened to reconcile them, and he said to Foma one day, on their way
      home:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you always quarrel with Yozhov?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why is he so self-conceited?&rdquo; said Foma, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is proud because you never know your lessons, and he always helps you
      out. He is clever. And because he is poor&mdash;is he to blame for that?
      He can learn anything he wants to, and he will be rich, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is like a mosquito,&rdquo; said Foma, disdainfully; &ldquo;he will buzz and buzz,
      and then of a sudden will bite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was something in the life of these boys that united them all;
      there were hours when the consciousness of difference in their natures and
      positions was entirely lost. On Sundays they all gathered at Smolin&rsquo;s,
      and, getting up on the roof of the wing, where they had an enormous
      pigeon-house, they let the pigeons loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beautiful, well-fed birds, ruffling their snow-white wings, darted out
      of the pigeon-house one by one, and, seating themselves in a row on the
      ridge of the roof, and, illumined by the sun, cooing, flaunted before the
      boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scare them!&rdquo; implored Yozhov, trembling for impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smolin swung a pole with a bast-wisp fastened to its end, and whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The frightened pigeons rushed into the air, filling it with the hurried
      flapping of their wings. And now, outlining big circles, they easily soar
      upwards, into the blue depths of the sky; they float higher and higher,
      their silver and snow-white feathers flashing. Some of them are striving
      to reach the dome of the skies with the light soaring of the falcon, their
      wings outstretched wide and almost motionless; others play, turn over in
      the air, now dropping downward in a snowy lump, now darting up like an
      arrow. Now the entire flock seems as though hanging motionless in the
      desert of the sky, and, growing smaller and smaller, seems to sink in it.
      With heads thrown back, the boys admire the birds in silence, without
      taking their eyes from them&mdash;their tired eyes, so radiant with calm
      joy, not altogether free from envying these winged creatures, which so
      freely took flight from earth up into the pure and calm atmosphere full of
      the glitter of the sun. The small group of scarcely visible dots, now mere
      specks in the azure of the sky, leads on the imagination of the children,
      and Yozhov expresses their common feeling when, in a low voice, he says
      thoughtfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way we ought to fly, friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While Foma, knowing that human souls, soaring heavenward, oftentimes
      assume the form of pigeons, felt in his breast the rising of a burning,
      powerful desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unified by their joy, attentively and mutely awaiting the return of their
      birds from the depths of the sky, the boys, pressing close to one another,
      drifted far away from the breath of life, even as their pigeons were far
      from earth; at this moment they are merely children, knowing neither envy
      nor anger; free from everything, they are near to one another, they are
      mute, judging their feelings by the light in their eyes&mdash;and they
      feel as happy as the birds in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the pigeons come down on the roof again, and, tired out by their
      flight, are easily driven into the pigeon-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends, let&rsquo;s go for apples?&rdquo; suggests Yozhov, the instigator of all
      games and adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      His call drives out of the children&rsquo;s souls the peacefulness brought into
      them by the pigeons, and then, like plunderers, carefully listening for
      each and every sound, they steal quietly across the back yards toward the
      neighbouring garden. The fear of being caught is balanced by the hope of
      stealing with impunity. But stealing is work and dangerous work at that,
      and everything that is earned by your own labour is so sweet! And the more
      effort required to gain it, the sweeter it is. Carefully the boys climb
      over the fence of the garden, and, bending down, crawl toward the apple
      trees and, full of fright, look around vigilantly. Their hearts tremble
      and their throbbing slackens at the faintest rustle. They are alike afraid
      of being caught, and, if noticed, of being recognised, but in case they
      should only see them and yell at them, they would be satisfied. They would
      separate, each going in a different direction, and then, meeting again,
      their eyes aglow with joy and boldness, would laughingly tell one another
      how they felt when they heard some one giving chase to them, and what
      happened to them when they ran so quickly through the garden, as though
      the ground were burning under their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such invasions were more to Foma&rsquo;s liking than all other adventures and
      games, and his behaviour during these invasions was marked with a boldness
      that at once astounded and angered his companions. He was intentionally
      careless in other people&rsquo;s gardens: he spoke loud, noisily broke the
      branches of apple trees, and, tearing off a worm-eaten apple, threw it in
      the direction of the proprietor&rsquo;s house. The danger of being caught in the
      act did not frighten him; it rather encouraged him&mdash;his eyes would
      turn darker, his teeth would clench, and his face would assume an
      expression of anger and pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smolin, distorting his big mouth contemptibly, would say to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making entirely too much fuss about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a coward anyway!&rdquo; replied Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that you are not a coward, but why do you boast of it? One may do
      a thing as well without boasting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov blamed him from a different point of view:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you thrust yourself into their hands willingly you can go to the
      devil! I am not your friend. They&rsquo;ll catch you and bring you to your
      father&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t do anything to you, while I would get such a
      spanking that all my bones would be skinned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coward!&rdquo; Foma persisted, stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it came to pass one day that Foma was caught by the second captain,
      Chumakov, a thin little old man. Noiselessly approaching the boy, who was
      hiding away in his bosom the stolen apples, the old man seized him by the
      shoulders and cried in a threatening voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I have you, little rogue! Aha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma was then about fifteen years old, and he cleverly slipped out of the
      old man&rsquo;s hands. Yet he did not run from him, but, knitting his brow and
      clenching his fist, he said threateningly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare to touch me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t touch you. I&rsquo;ll just turn you over to the police! Whose son
      are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma did not expect this, and all his boldness and spitefulness suddenly
      left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trip to the police station seemed to him something which his father
      would never forgive him. He shuddered and said confusedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gordyeeff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ignat Gordyeeff&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the second captain was taken aback. He straightened himself, expanded
      his chest and for some reason or other cleared his throat impressively.
      Then his shoulders sank and he said to the boy in a fatherly tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame! The son of such a well-known and respected man! It is
      unbecoming your position. You may go. But should this happen again! Hm! I
      should be compelled to notify your father, to whom, by the way, I have the
      honour of presenting my respects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma watched the play of the old man&rsquo;s physiognomy and understood that he
      was afraid of his father. Like a young wolf, he looked askance at
      Chumakov; while the old man, with comical seriousness, twisted his gray
      moustache, hesitating before the boy, who did not go away, notwithstanding
      the given permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go,&rdquo; repeated the old man, pointing at the road leading to his
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about the police?&rdquo; asked Foma, sternly, and was immediately
      frightened at the possible answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was but jesting,&rdquo; smiled the old man. &ldquo;I just wanted to frighten you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are afraid of my father yourself,&rdquo; said Foma, and, turning his back
      to the old man, walked off into the depth of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid? Ah! Very well!&rdquo; exclaimed Chumakov after him, and Foma knew
      by the sound of his voice that he had offended the old man. He felt sad
      and ashamed; he passed the afternoon in walking, and, coming home, he was
      met by his father&rsquo;s stern question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foma! Did you go to Chumakov&rsquo;s garden?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said the boy, calmly, looking into his father&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently Ignat did not expect such an answer and he was silent for
      awhile, stroking his beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool! Why did you do it? Have you not enough of your own apples?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma cast down his eyes and was silent, standing before his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, you are shamed! Yozhishka must have incited you to this! I&rsquo;ll give
      it to him when he comes, or I&rsquo;ll make an end of your friendship
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did it myself,&rdquo; said Foma, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From bad to worse!&rdquo; exclaimed Ignat. &ldquo;But why did you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because!&rdquo; mocked the father. &ldquo;Well, if you did it you ought to be able to
      explain to yourself and to others the reason for so doing. Come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma walked up to his father, who was sitting on a chair, and placed
      himself between his knees. Ignat put his hand on the boy&rsquo;s shoulders, and,
      smiling, looked into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ashamed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ashamed,&rdquo; sighed Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have it, fool! You have disgraced me and yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pressing his son&rsquo;s head to his breast, he stroked his hair and asked
      again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you do such a thing&mdash;stealing other people&rsquo;s apples?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Foma, confusedly. &ldquo;Perhaps because it is so
      lonesome. I play and play the same thing day after day. I am growing tired
      of it! While this is dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exciting?&rdquo; asked the father, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm, perhaps it is so. But, nevertheless, Foma, look out&mdash;drop this,
      or I shall deal with you severely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never climb anywhere again,&rdquo; said the boy with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that you take all the blame on yourself&mdash;that is good. What will
      become of you in the future, only God knows, but meanwhile&mdash;it is
      pretty good. It is not a trifle if a man is willing to pay for his deeds
      with his own skin. Someone else in your place would have blamed his
      friends, while you say: &lsquo;I did it myself.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s the proper way, Foma.
      You commit the sin, but you also account for it. Didn&rsquo;t Chumakov strike
      you?&rdquo; asked Ignat, pausing as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would have struck him back,&rdquo; declared Foma, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; roared his father, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him that he was afraid of you. That is why he complained.
      Otherwise he was not going to say anything to you about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;By God! Present my respects to your father,&rsquo; he said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the dog! See what kind of people there are; he is robbed and yet he
      makes a bow and presents his respects! Ha, ha! It is true it might have
      been worth no more than a kopeck, but a kopeck is to him what a rouble is
      to me. And it isn&rsquo;t the kopeck, but since it is mine, no one dares touch
      it unless I throw it away myself. Eh! The devil take them! Well, tell me&mdash;where
      have you been, what have you seen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy sat down beside his father and told him in detail all the
      impressions of that day. Ignat listened, fixedly watching the animated
      face of his son, and the eyebrows of the big man contracted pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still but floating on the surface, dear. You are still but a
      child. Eh! Eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We scared an owl in the ravine,&rdquo; related the boy. &ldquo;That was fun! It began
      to fly about and struck against a tree&mdash;bang! It even began to squeak
      so pitifully. And we scared it again; again it rose and flew about here
      and there, and again it struck against something, so that its feathers
      were coming out. It flew about in the ravine and at last hid itself
      somewhere with difficulty. We did not try to look for it, we felt sorry it
      was all bruised. Papa, is an owl entirely blind in daytime?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blind!&rdquo; said Ignat; &ldquo;some men will toss about in life even as this owl in
      daytime. Ever searching for his place, he strives and strives&mdash;only
      feathers fly from him, but all to no purpose. He is bruised, sickened,
      stripped of everything, and then with all his might he thrusts himself
      anywhere, just to find repose from his restlessness. Woe to such people.
      Woe to them, dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How painful is it to them?&rdquo; said Foma in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as painful as to that owl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why is it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? It is hard to tell. Someone suffers because he is darkened by his
      pride&mdash;he desires much, but has but little strength. Another because
      of his foolishness. But then there are a thousand and one other reasons,
      which you cannot understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in and have some tea,&rdquo; Anfisa called to them. She had been standing
      in the doorway for quite a long while, and, folding her hands, lovingly
      admired the enormous figure of her brother, who bent over Foma with such
      friendliness, and the pensive pose of the boy, who clung to his father&rsquo;s
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus day by day Foma&rsquo;s life developed slowly&mdash;a quiet, peaceful life,
      not at all brimful of emotions. Powerful impressions, rousing the boy&rsquo;s
      soul for an hour or for a day, sometimes stood out strikingly against the
      general background of this monotonous life, but these were soon
      obliterated. The boy&rsquo;s soul was as yet but a calm lake&mdash;a lake hidden
      from the stormy winds of life, and all that touched the surface of the
      lake either sank to the bottom, stirring the placid water for a moment, or
      gliding over the smooth surface, swam apart in big circles and
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having stayed at the district school for five years, Foma passed four
      classes tolerably well and came out a brave, dark-haired fellow, with a
      swarthy face, heavy eyebrows and dark down on the upper lip. His big dark
      eyes had a naive and pensive look, and his lips were like a child&rsquo;s,
      half-open; but when meeting with opposition to his desires or when
      irritated by something else, the pupils of his eyes would grow wide, his
      lips press tight, and his whole face assume a stubborn and resolute
      expression. His godfather, smiling sceptically, would often say to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To women, Foma, you&rsquo;ll be sweeter than honey, but as yet not much common
      sense can be seen in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ignat would heave a sigh at these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better start out your son as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s time yet, wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why wait? He&rsquo;ll go about the Volga for two or three years and then we&rsquo;ll
      have him married. There&rsquo;s my Lubov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov Mayakina was now studying in the fifth class of some boarding
      school. Foma often met her on the street at which meeting she always bowed
      condescendingly, her fair head in a fashionable cap. Foma liked her, but
      her rosy cheeks, her cheerful brown eyes and crimson lips could not smooth
      the impression of offence given to him by her condescending bows. She was
      acquainted with some Gymnasium students, and although Yozhov, his old
      friend, was among them, Foma felt no inclination to be with them, and
      their company embarrassed him. It seemed to him that they were all
      boasting of their learning before him and that they were mocking his
      ignorance. Gathered together in Lubov&rsquo;s house they would read some books,
      and whenever he found them reading or loudly arguing, they became silent
      at his sight. All this removed them further from him. One day when he was
      at Mayakin&rsquo;s, Luba called him to go for a walk in the garden, and there,
      walking by his side, asked him with a grimace on her face:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so unsociable? You never talk about anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I talk about, since I know nothing!&rdquo; said Foma, plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Study&mdash;read books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like doing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, the Gymnasium students know everything, and know how to talk
      about everything. Take Yozhov, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know Yozhov&mdash;a chatterbox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You simply envy him. He is very clever&mdash;yes. He will soon graduate
      from the Gymnasium&mdash;and then he&rsquo;ll go to Moscow to study in the
      University.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; said Foma, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll remain just an ignorant man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be it so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be nice!&rdquo; exclaimed Luba, ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall hold my ground without science,&rdquo; said Foma, sarcastically. &ldquo;And
      I&rsquo;ll have a laugh at all the learned people. Let the hungry study. I don&rsquo;t
      need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw, how stupid you are, bad, disgusting!&rdquo; said the girl with contempt
      and went away, leaving him alone in the garden. Offended and gloomy, he
      looked after her, moved his eyebrows and lowering his head, slowly walked
      off into the depth of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      He already began to recognise the beauty of solitude and the sweet poison
      of contemplation. Oftentimes, during summer evenings, when everything was
      coloured by the fiery tints of sunset, kindling the imagination, an uneasy
      longing for something incomprehensible penetrated his breast. Sitting
      somewhere in a dark corner of the garden or lying in bed, he conjured up
      before him the images of the fairy-tale princesses&mdash;they appeared
      with the face of Luba and of other young ladies of his acquaintance,
      noiselessly floating before him in the twilight and staring into his eyes
      with enigmatic looks. At times these visions awakened in him a mighty
      energy, as though intoxicating him&mdash;he would rise and, straightening
      his shoulders, inhale the perfumed air with a full chest; but sometimes
      these same visions brought to him a feeling of sadness&mdash;he felt like
      crying, but ashamed of shedding tears, he restrained himself and never
      wept in silence. Or suddenly his heart began to tremble with the desire to
      express his gratitude to God, to bow before Him; the words of the prayer
      flashed through his memory, and beholding the sky, he whispered them for a
      long time, one by one, and his heart grew lighter, breathing into prayer
      the excess of his power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father patiently and carefully introduced him into commercial circles,
      took him on the Exchange, told him about his contracts and enterprises,
      about his co-associates, described to him how they had made their way,
      what fortunes they now possessed, what natures were theirs. Foma soon
      mastered it, regarding everything seriously and thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our bud is blooming into a blood-red cup-rose!&rdquo; Mayakin smiled, winking
      to Ignat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, even when Foma was nineteen years old, there was something
      childish in him, something naive which distinguished him from the boys of
      his age. They were laughing at him, considering him stupid; he kept away
      from them, offended by their relations toward him. As for his father and
      Mayakin, who were watching him vigilantly, this uncertainty of Foma&rsquo;s
      character inspired them with serious apprehensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand him!&rdquo; Ignat would say with contrite heart. &ldquo;He does
      not lead a dissipated life, he does not seem to run after the women,
      treats me and you with respect, listens to everything&mdash;he is more
      like a pretty girl than a fellow! And yet he does not seem to be stupid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothing particularly stupid about him,&rdquo; said Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks as though he were waiting for something&mdash;as though some
      kind of shroud were covering his eyes. His late mother groped on earth in
      the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just look, there&rsquo;s Afrikanka Smolin, but two years older than my boy&mdash;what
      a man he has become! That is, it is difficult to tell whether he is his
      father&rsquo;s head or his father his. He wants to go to some factory to study.
      He swears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Eh,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;papa, you have not taught me enough.&rsquo; Yes. While mine
      does not express himself at all. Oh Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Mayakin advised him, &ldquo;you had better push him head foremost
      into some active business! I assure you! Gold is tested in fire. We&rsquo;ll see
      what his inclinations are when at liberty. Send him out on the Kama&mdash;alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To give him a trial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll do some mischief&mdash;you&rsquo;ll lose something&mdash;but then
      we&rsquo;ll know what stuff he is made of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed&mdash;I&rsquo;ll send him off,&rdquo; Ignat decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus in the spring, Ignat sent his son off on the Kama with two barges
      laden with corn. The barges were led by Gordyeeff&rsquo;s steamer &ldquo;Philezhny,&rdquo;
       under the command of Foma&rsquo;s old acquaintance, the former sailor Yefim&mdash;now,
      Yefim Ilyich, a squarely built man of about thirty with lynx-like eyes&mdash;a
      sober-minded, steady and very strict captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sailed fast and cheerfully, because all were contented. At first Foma
      was proud of the responsible commission with which he had been charged.
      Yefim was pleased with the presence of the young master, who did not
      rebuke or abuse him for each and every oversight; and the happy frame of
      mind of the two most important persons on the steamer reflected in
      straight rays on the entire crew. Having left the place where they had
      taken in their cargo of corn in April, the steamer reached the place of
      its destination in the beginning of May, and the barges were anchored near
      the shore with the steamer at their side. Foma&rsquo;s duty was to deliver the
      corn as soon as possible, and receiving the payments, start off for Perm,
      where a cargo of iron was awaiting him, which Ignat had undertaken to
      deliver at the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barges stood opposite a large village, near a pine forest, about two
      versts distant from the shore. On the very next day after their arrival, a
      big and noisy crowd of women and peasants, on foot and on horses, came up
      to the shore early in the morning. Shouting and singing, they scattered on
      the decks and in an instant work started expeditiously. Having descended
      into the holds, the women were filling the sacks with rye, the peasants,
      throwing the sacks upon their shoulders, ran over the gang-planks to the
      shore, and from the shore, carts, heavily laden with the long-expected
      corn, went off slowly to the village. The women sang songs; the peasants
      jested and gaily abused one another; the sailors representing the
      guardians of peace, scolded the working people now and then; the
      gang-planks, bending under the feet of the carriers, splashed against the
      water heavily; while on the shore the horses neighed, and the carts and
      the sand under the wheels were creaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had just risen, the air was fresh and invigorating and densely
      filled with the odour of pines; the calm water of the river, reflecting
      the clear sky, was gently murmuring, breaking against the sides of the
      vessels and the chains of the anchors. The loud and cheerful noise of
      toil, the youthful beauty of nature, gaily illumined by the sunbeams&mdash;all
      was full of a kind-hearted, somewhat crude, sound power, which pleasantly
      stirred Foma&rsquo;s soul, awakening in him new and perplexed sensations and
      desires. He was sitting by the table under the awning of the steamer and
      drinking tea, together with Yefim and the receiver of the corn, a
      provincial clerk&mdash;a redheaded, short-sighted gentleman in glasses.
      Nervously shrugging his shoulders the receiver was telling in a hoarse
      voice how the peasants were starving, but Foma paid little attention to
      his words, looking now at the work below, now at the other side of the
      river&mdash;a tall, yellow, sandy steep shore, whose edges were covered
      with pine trees. It was unpeopled and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to go over there,&rdquo; thought Foma. And as though from a distance
      the receiver&rsquo;s tiresome, unpleasant, harsh voice fell on his ears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe it&mdash;at last it became horrible! Such an
      incident took place! A peasant came up to a certain intelligent man in Osa
      and brought along with him a girl about sixteen years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What do you wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve brought my daughter to your Honour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll take her&mdash;you are a bachelor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That is, how? What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I took her around town,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;I wanted to hire her out as a servant&mdash;but
      nobody would have her&mdash;take her at least as your mistress!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand? He offered his own daughter&mdash;just think of it! A
      daughter&mdash;as a mistress! The devil knows what that is! Eh? The man,
      of course, became indignant and began abusing the peasant. But the peasant
      spoke to him reasonably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Your Honour! Of what use is she to me at this time? Utterly useless. I
      have,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;three boys&mdash;they will be working men; it is
      necessary to keep them up. Give me,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;ten roubles for the girl,
      and that will improve my lot and that of my boys.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that? Eh? It is simply terrible, I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good!&rdquo; sighed Yefim. &ldquo;As they say&mdash;hunger will break through
      stone walls. The stomach, you see, has its own laws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This story called forth in Foma a great incomprehensible interest in the
      fate of the girl, and the youth hastened to enquire of the receiver:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did the man buy her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; exclaimed the receiver, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and what became of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some good people took pity on her&mdash;and provided for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-h!&rdquo; drawled Foma, and suddenly he said firmly and angrily: &ldquo;I would
      have given that peasant such a thrashing! I would have broken his head!&rdquo;
       And he showed the receiver his big tightly-clenched fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! What for?&rdquo; cried the receiver in a sickly, loud voice, tearing his
      spectacles from his eyes. &ldquo;You do not understand the motive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do understand it!&rdquo; said Foma, with an obstinate shake of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what could he do? It came to his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can one allow himself to sell a human being?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! It is brutal, I agree with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a girl at that! I would have given him the ten roubles!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The receiver waved his hand hopelessly and became silent. His gesture
      confused Foma. He arose from his seat, walked off to the railing and
      looked down at the deck of the barge, which was covered with an
      industriously working crowd of people. The noise intoxicated him, and the
      uneasy something, which was rambling in his soul, was now defined into a
      powerful desire to work, to have the strength of a giant, to possess
      enormous shoulders and put on them at one time a hundred bags of rye, that
      every one looking at him might be astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, hurry up there!&rdquo; he shouted down in a ringing voice. A few
      heads were raised to him, some faces appeared before him, and one of them&mdash;the
      face of a dark-eyed woman&mdash;smiled at him a gentle and enticing smile.
      Something flared up in his breast at this smile and began to spread over
      his veins in a hot wave. He drew back from the railing and walked up to
      the table again, feeling that his cheeks were burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said the receiver, addressing him, &ldquo;wire to your father asking
      him to allow some grain for waste! Just see how much is lost here. And
      here every pound is precious! You should have understood this! What a fine
      father you have,&rdquo; he concluded with a biting grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much shall I allow?&rdquo; asked Foma, boldly and disdainfully. &ldquo;Do you
      want a hundred puds? [A pud is a weight of 40 Russian pounds.] Two
      hundred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I thank you!&rdquo; exclaimed the receiver, overjoyed and confused, &ldquo;if
      you have the right to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the master!&rdquo; said Foma, firmly. &ldquo;And you must not speak that way
      about my father&mdash;nor make such faces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me! I&mdash;I do not doubt that you have full power. I thank you
      heartily. And your father, too&mdash;in behalf of all these men&mdash;in
      behalf of the people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yefim looked cautiously at the young master, spreading out and smacking
      his lips, while the master with an air of pride on his face listened to
      the quick-witted speech of the receiver, who was pressing his hand firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred puds! That is Russian-like, young man! I shall directly
      notify the peasants of your gift. You&rsquo;ll see how grateful they will be&mdash;how
      glad.&rdquo; And he shouted down:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, boys! The master is giving away two hundred puds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred!&rdquo; interposed Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three hundred puds. Oh! Thank you! Three hundred puds of grain, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But their response was weak. The peasants lifted up their heads and mutely
      lowered them again, resuming their work. A few voices said irresolutely
      and as though unwillingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. May God give you. We thank you very humbly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And some cried out gaily and disdainfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of that? If they had given each of us a glass of vodka
      instead&mdash;that would be a just favour. For the grain is not for us&mdash;but
      for the country Council.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! They do not understand!&rdquo; exclaimed the receiver, confused. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go
      down and explain it to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he disappeared. But the peasants&rsquo; regard for his gift did not interest
      Foma. He saw that the black eyes of the rosy-cheeked woman were looking at
      him so strangely and pleasingly. They seemed to thank him and caressingly
      beckoned him, and besides those eyes he saw nothing. The woman was dressed
      like the city women. She wore shoes, a calico waist, and over her black
      hair she had a peculiar kerchief. Tall and supple, seated on a pile of
      wood, she repaired sacks, quickly moving her hands, which were bare up to
      the elbows, and she smiled at Foma all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foma Ignatyich!&rdquo; he heard Yefim&rsquo;s reproachful voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve showed off
      too much. Well, if it were only about fifty puds! But why so much? Look
      out that we don&rsquo;t get a good scolding for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me alone!&rdquo; said Foma, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it to me? I&rsquo;ll keep quiet. But as you are so young, and as I was
      told to keep an eye on you, I may get a rap on the snout for being
      heedless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell my father all about it. Keep quiet!&rdquo; said Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for me&mdash;let it be so&mdash;so that you are master here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said this, Foma Ignatyich, for your own sake&mdash;because you are
      so young and simple-minded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me alone, Yefim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yefim heaved a sigh and became silent, while Foma stared at the woman and
      thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish they would bring such a woman for sale to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His heart beat rapidly. Though as yet physically pure, he already knew
      from conversations the mysteries of intimate relations between men and
      women. He knew by rude and shameful names, and these names kindled in him
      an unpleasant, burning curiosity and shame; his imagination worked
      obstinately, for he could not picture it to himself in intelligible
      images. And in his soul he did not believe that those relations were
      really so simple and rude, as he had been told. When they had laughed at
      him and assured him that they were such, and, indeed, could not be
      otherwise, he smiled stupidly and confusedly, but thought nevertheless
      that the relations with women did not have to be in such a shameful form
      for everyone, and that, in all probability, there was something purer,
      less rude and abusive to a human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now looking at the dark-eyed working woman with admiration, Foma
      distinctly felt just that rude inclination toward her, and he was ashamed
      and afraid of something. And Yefim, standing beside him, said
      admonitively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are staring at the woman, so that I cannot keep silence any
      longer. You do not know her, but when she winks at you, you may, because
      of your youth&mdash;and with a nature like yours&mdash;you may do such a
      thing that we&rsquo;ll have to go home on foot by the shore. And we&rsquo;ll have to
      thank God if our trousers at least remain with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked Foma, red with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want nothing. And you had better mind me. In regard to affairs with
      women I may perfectly well be a teacher. You must deal with a woman very
      plainly&mdash;give her a bottle of vodka, something to eat after it, then
      a couple of bottles of beer and after everything give her twenty kopecks
      in cash. For this price she will show you all her love in the best way
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lying,&rdquo; said Foma, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am lying? Why shall I lie to you since I have observed that same policy
      perhaps a hundred times? Just charge me to have dealings with her. Eh?
      I&rsquo;ll make you acquainted with her in a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Foma, feeling that he could hardly breathe and that
      something was choking his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll bring her up in the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Yefim smiled approvingly into Foma&rsquo;s face and walked off. Until
      evening Foma walked about as though lost in mist, not noticing the
      respectful and beseeching glances with which the peasants greeted him at
      the receiver&rsquo;s instigation. Dread fell on him, he felt himself guilty
      before somebody, and to all those that addressed him he replied humbly and
      gently, as though excusing himself for something. Some of the working
      people went home toward evening, others gathered on the shore near a big,
      bright bonfire and began cooking their supper. Fragments of their
      conversation floated about in the stillness of the evening. The reflection
      of the fire fell on the river in red and yellow stripes, which trembled on
      the calm water and on the window panes of the cabin where Foma was
      sitting. He sat in the corner on a lounge, which was covered with oilcloth&mdash;and
      waited. On the table before him were a few bottles of vodka and beer, and
      plates with bread and dessert. He covered the windows and did not light
      the lamp; the faint light from the bonfire, penetrating through the
      curtains, fell on the table, on the bottles and on the wall, and trembled,
      now growing brighter, now fainter. It was quiet on the steamer and on the
      barges, only from the shore came indistinct sounds of conversation, and
      the river was splashing, scarcely audible, against the sides of the
      steamer. It seemed to Foma that somebody was hiding in the dark near by,
      listening to him and spying upon him. Now somebody is walking over the
      gang-plank of the barges with quick and heavy steps&mdash;the gang-plank
      strikes against the water clangously and angrily. Foma hears the muffled
      laughter of the captain and his lowered voice. Yefim stands by the cabin
      door and speaks softly, but somewhat reprimandingly, as though
      instructing. Foma suddenly felt like crying out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he arose from the lounge&mdash;but at this moment the cabin door was
      opened, the tall form of a woman appeared on the threshold, and,
      noiselessly closing the door behind her, she said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear! How dark it is! Is there a living soul somewhere around here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Foma, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, good evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the woman moved forward carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll light the lamp,&rdquo; said Foma in a broken voice, and, sinking on the
      lounge, he curled himself up in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good enough this way. When you get used to it you can see
      everything in the dark as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be seated,&rdquo; said Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down on the lounge about two steps away from him. Foma saw the
      glitter of her eyes, he saw a smile on her full lips. It seemed to him
      that this smile of hers was not at all like that other smile before&mdash;this
      smile seemed plaintive, sad. This smile encouraged him; he breathed with
      less difficulty at the sight of these eyes, which, on meeting his own,
      suddenly glanced down on the floor. But he did not know what to say to
      this woman and for about two minutes both were silent. It was a heavy,
      awkward silence. She began to speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be feeling lonesome here all alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you like our place here?&rdquo; asked the woman in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nice. There are many woods here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again they became silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The river, if you like, is more beautiful than the Volga,&rdquo; uttered Foma,
      with an effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on the Volga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the city of Simbirsk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simbirsk?&rdquo; repeated Foma like an echo, feeling that he was again unable
      to say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she evidently understood with whom she had to deal, and she suddenly
      asked him in a bold whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you treat me to something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Foma gave a start. &ldquo;Indeed, how queer I am? Well, then, come up to
      the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bustled about in the dark, pushed the table, took up one bottle, then
      another, and again returned them to their place, laughing guiltily and
      confusedly as he did so. She came up close to him and stood by his side,
      and, smiling, looked at his face and at his trembling hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you bashful?&rdquo; she suddenly whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her breath on his cheek and replied just as softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she placed her hands on his shoulders and quietly drew him to her
      breast, saying in a soothing whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, don&rsquo;t be bashful, my young, handsome darling. How I pity
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he felt like crying because of her whisper, his heart was melting in
      sweet fatigue; pressing his head close to her breast, he clasped her with
      his hands, mumbling to her some inarticulate words, which were unknown to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be gone!&rdquo; said Foma in a heavy voice, staring at the wall with his eyes
      wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having kissed him on the cheek she walked out of the cabin, saying to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma felt intolerably ashamed in her presence; but no sooner did she
      disappear behind the door than he jumped up and seated himself on the
      lounge. Then he arose, staggering, and at once he was seized with the
      feeling of having lost something very valuable, something whose presence
      he did not seem to have noticed in himself until the moment it was lost.
      But immediately a new, manly feeling of self-pride took possession of him.
      It drowned his shame, and, instead of the shame, pity for the woman sprang
      up within him&mdash;for the half-clad woman, who went out alone into the
      dark of the chilly May night. He hastily came out on the deck&mdash;it was
      a starlit, but moonless night; the coolness and the darkness embraced him.
      On the shore the golden-red pile of coals was still glimmering. Foma
      listened&mdash;an oppressive stillness filled the air, only the water was
      murmuring, breaking against the anchor chains. There was not a sound of
      footsteps to be heard. Foma now longed to call the woman, but he did not
      know her name. Eagerly inhaling the fresh air into his broad chest, he
      stood on deck for a few minutes. Suddenly, from beyond the roundhouse&mdash;from
      the prow&mdash;a moan reached his ears&mdash;a deep, loud moan, resembling
      a wail. He shuddered and went thither carefully, understanding that she
      was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat on the deck close to the side of the steamer, and, leaning her
      head against a heap of ropes, she wept. Foma saw that her bare white
      shoulders were trembling, he heard her pitiful moans, and began to feel
      depressed. Bending over her, he asked her timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded her head and said nothing in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I offended you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, how?&rdquo; said Foma, alarmed and confused, touching her head with his
      hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry. You came of your own free will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not angry!&rdquo; she replied in a loud whisper. &ldquo;Why should I be angry at
      you? You are not a seducer. You are a pure soul! Eh, my darling! Be seated
      here by my side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And taking Foma by the hand, she made him sit down, like a child, in her
      lap, pressed his head close to her breast, and, bending over him, pressed
      her lips to his for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you crying about?&rdquo; asked Foma, caressing her cheek with one
      hand, while the other clasped the woman&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am crying about myself. Why have you sent me away?&rdquo; she asked
      plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I began to feel ashamed of myself,&rdquo; said Foma, lowering his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling! Tell me the truth&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you been pleased with me?&rdquo;
       she asked with a smile, but her big, hot tears were still trickling down
      on Foma&rsquo;s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you speak like this?&rdquo; exclaimed the youth, almost frightened,
      and hotly began to mumble to her some words about her beauty, about her
      kindness, telling her how sorry he was for her and how bashful in her
      presence. And she listened and kept on kissing his cheeks, his neck, his
      head and his uncovered breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became silent&mdash;then she began to speak&mdash;softly and mournfully
      as though speaking of the dead:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I thought it was something else. When you said, &lsquo;Be gone!&rsquo; I got up
      and went away. And your words made me feel sad, very sad. There was a
      time, I remembered, when they caressed me and fondled me unceasingly,
      without growing tired; for a single kind smile they used to do for me
      anything I pleased. I recalled all this and began to cry! I felt sorry for
      my youth, for I am now thirty years old, the last days for a woman! Eh,
      Foma Ignatyevich!&rdquo; she exclaimed, lifting her voice louder, and
      reiterating the rhythm of her harmonious speech, whose accents rose and
      fell in unison with the melodious murmuring of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me&mdash;preserve your youth! There is nothing in the world
      better than that. There is nothing more precious than youth. With youth,
      as with gold, you can accomplish anything you please. Live so that you
      shall have in old age something to remind you of your youth. Here I
      recalled myself, and though I cried, yet my heart blazed up at the very
      recollection of my past life. And again I was young, as though I drank of
      the water of life! My sweet child I&rsquo;ll have a good time with you, if I
      please you, we&rsquo;ll enjoy ourselves as much as we can. Eh! I&rsquo;ll burn to
      ashes, now that I have blazed up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And pressing the youth close to herself, she greedily began to kiss him on
      the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lo-o-ok o-u-u-u-t!&rdquo; the watch on the barge wailed mournfully, and,
      cutting short the last syllable, began to strike his mallet against the
      cast-iron board.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shrill, trembling sounds harshly broke the solemn quiet of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, when the barges had discharged their cargo and the
      steamer was ready to leave for Perm, Yefim noticed, to his great sorrow,
      that a cart came up to the shore and that the dark-eyed Pelageya, with a
      trunk and with some bundles, was in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send a sailor to bring her things,&rdquo; ordered Foma, nodding his head toward
      the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a reproachful shake of his head, Yefim carried out the order angrily,
      and then asked in a lowered voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she, too, is coming with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is going with me,&rdquo; Foma announced shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is understood. Not with all of us. Oh, Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you sighing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Foma Ignatyich! We are going to a big city. Are there not plenty of
      women of her kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, keep quiet!&rdquo; said Foma, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will keep quiet, but this isn&rsquo;t right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This very wantonness of ours. Our steamer is perfect, clean&mdash;and
      suddenly there is a woman there! And if it were at least the right sort of
      a woman! But as it is, she merely bears the name of woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma frowned insinuatingly and addressed the captain, imperiously
      emphasizing his words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yefim, I want you to bear it in mind, and to tell it to everybody here,
      that if anyone will utter an obscene word about her, I&rsquo;ll strike him on
      the head with a log of wood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; said Yefim, incredulously, looking into the master&rsquo;s face
      with curiosity. But he immediately made a step backward. Ignat&rsquo;s son, like
      a wolf, showed his teeth, the apples of his eyes became wider, and he
      roared:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laugh! I&rsquo;ll show you how to laugh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Though Yefim lost courage, he nevertheless said with dignity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although you, Foma Ignatyich, are the master, yet as I was told, &lsquo;Watch,
      Yefim,&rsquo; and then I am the captain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The captain?&rdquo; cried Foma, shuddering in every limb and turning pale. &ldquo;And
      who am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t bawl! On account of such a trifle as a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Red spots came out on Foma&rsquo;s pale face, he shifted from one foot to the
      other, thrust his hands into the pockets of his jacket with a convulsive
      motion and said in a firm and even voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! Captain! See here, say another word against me&mdash;and you go to
      the devil! I&rsquo;ll put you ashore! I&rsquo;ll get along as well with the pilot!
      Understand? You cannot command me. Do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yefim was dumfounded. He looked at his master and comically winked his
      eyes, finding no reply to his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand, I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I understand!&rdquo; drawled Yefim. &ldquo;But what is all this noise about? On
      account of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma&rsquo;s eyes, which flashed wildly, and his face distorted with wrath,
      suggested to the captain the happy thought to leave his master as soon as
      possible and, turning around quickly, he walked off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! How terrible! As it seems the apple did not fall too far from the
      tree,&rdquo; he muttered sneeringly, walking on the deck. He was angry at Foma,
      and considered himself offended for nothing, but at the same time he began
      to feel over himself the real, firm hand of a master. For years accustomed
      to being subordinate, he rather liked this manifestation of power over
      him, and, entering the cabin of the old pilot, he related to him the scene
      between himself and his master, with a shade of satisfaction in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See?&rdquo; he concluded his story. &ldquo;A pup coming from a good breed is an
      excellent dog at the very first chase. From his exterior he is so-so. A
      man of rather heavy mind as yet. Well, never mind, let him have his fun.
      It seems now as though nothing wrong will come out of this. With a
      character like his, no. How he bawled at me! A regular trumpet, I tell
      you! And he appointed himself master at once. As though he had sipped
      power and strictness out of a ladle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yefim spoke the truth: during these few days Foma underwent a striking
      transformation. The passion now kindled in him made him master of the soul
      and body of a woman; he eagerly absorbed the fiery sweetness of this
      power, and this burned out all that was awkward in him, all that gave him
      the appearance of a somewhat stupid, gloomy fellow, and, destroying it,
      filled his heart with youthful pride, with the consciousness of his human
      personality. Love for a woman is always fruitful to the man, be the love
      whatever it may; even though it were to cause but sufferings there is
      always much that is rich in it. Working as a powerful poison on those
      whose souls are afflicted, it is for the healthy man as fire for iron,
      which is to be transformed into steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma&rsquo;s passion for the thirty-year-old woman, who lamented in his embraces
      her dead youth, did not tear him away from his affairs; he was never lost
      in the caresses, or in his affairs, bringing into both his whole self. The
      woman, like good wine, provoked in him alike a thirst for labour and for
      love, and she, too, became younger from the kisses of the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Perm, Foma found a letter waiting for him. It was from his godfather,
      who notified him that Ignat, out of anxiety for his son, had begun to
      drink heavily, and that it was harmful to drink thus, for a man of his
      age. The letter concluded with advice to hurry up matters in order to
      return home the sooner. Foma felt alarmed over this advice, and it clouded
      the clear holiday of his heart. But this shadow soon melted in his worries
      over his affairs, and in the caresses of Pelageya. His life streamed on
      with the swiftness of a river wave, and each day brought to him new
      sensations, awakening in him new thoughts. Pelageya&rsquo;s relations with him
      contained all the passion of a mistress, all that power of feeling which
      women of her age put into their passion when drinking the last drops from
      the cup of life. But at times a different feeling awoke in her, a feeling
      not less powerful, and by which Foma became still more attached to her&mdash;something
      similar to a mother&rsquo;s yearning to guard her beloved son from errors, to
      teach him the wisdom of life. Oftentimes at night, sitting in his embraces
      on the deck, she spoke to him tenderly and sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind me as an older sister of yours. I have lived, I know men. I have
      seen a great deal in my life! Choose your companions with care, for there
      are people just as contagious as a disease. At first you cannot tell them
      even when you see them; he looks to be a man like everybody else, and,
      suddenly, without being aware of it yourself, you will start to imitate
      him in life. You look around&mdash;and you find that you have contracted
      his scabs. I myself have lost everything on account of a friend. I had a
      husband and two children. We lived well. My husband was a clerk at a
      volost.&rdquo; She became silent and looked for a long time at the water, which
      was stirred by the vessel. Then she heaved a sigh and spoke to him again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May the Holy Virgin guard you from women of my kind&mdash;be careful. You
      are tender as yet, your heart has not become properly hardened. And women
      are fond of such as you&mdash;strong, handsome, rich. And most of all
      beware of the quiet women. They stick to a man like blood-suckers, and
      suck and suck. And at the same time they are always so kind, so gentle.
      They will keep on sucking your juice, but will preserve themselves.
      They&rsquo;ll only break your heart in vain. You had better have dealings with
      those that are bold, like myself. These live not for the sake of gain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she was indeed disinterested. In Perm Foma purchased for her different
      new things and what-not. She was delighted, but later, having examined
      them, she said sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t squander your money too freely. See that your father does not get
      angry. I love you anyway, without all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had already told him that she would go with him only as far as Kazan,
      where she had a married sister. Foma could not believe that she would
      leave him, and when, on the eve of their arrival at Kazan, she repeated
      her words, he became gloomy and began to implore her not to forsake him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not feel sorry in advance,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We have a whole night before
      us. You will have time to feel sorry when I bid you good-bye, if you will
      feel sorry at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he still tried to persuade her not to forsake him, and, finally&mdash;which
      was to be expected&mdash;announced his desire to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, so!&rdquo; and she began to laugh. &ldquo;Shall I marry you while my husband is
      still alive? My darling, my queer fellow! You have a desire to marry, eh?
      But do they marry such women as I am? You will have many, many mistresses.
      Marry then, when you have overflowed, when you have had your fill of all
      sweets and feel like having rye bread. Then you may marry! I have noticed
      that a healthy man, for his own peace, must not marry early. One woman
      will not be enough to satisfy him, and he&rsquo;ll go to other women. And for
      your own happiness, you should take a wife only when you know that she
      alone will suffice for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the more she spoke, the more persistent Foma became in his desire not
      to part with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just listen to what I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said the woman, calmly. &ldquo;A splinter
      of wood is burning in your hand, and you can see well even without its
      light&mdash;you had better dip it into water, so that there will be no
      smell of smoke and your hand will not be burned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand your words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do understand. You have done me no wrong, and I do not wish to do you
      any. And, therefore, I am going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is hard to say what might have been the result of this dispute if an
      accident had not interfered with it. In Kazan Foma received a telegram
      from Mayakin, who wrote to his godson briefly: &ldquo;Come immediately on the
      passenger steamer.&rdquo; Foma&rsquo;s heart contracted nervously, and a few hours
      later, gloomy and pale, his teeth set together, he stood on the deck of
      the steamer, which was leaving the harbour, and clinging to the rail with
      his hands, he stared motionlessly into the face of his love, who was
      floating far away from him together with the harbour and the shore.
      Pelageya waved her handkerchief and smiled, but he knew that she was
      crying, shedding many painful tears. From her tears the entire front of
      Foma&rsquo;s shirt was wet, and from her tears, his heart, full of gloomy alarm,
      was sad and cold. The figure of the woman was growing smaller and smaller,
      as though melting away, and Foma, without lifting his eyes, stared at her
      and felt that aside from fear for his father and sorrow for the woman,
      some new, powerful and caustic sensation was awakening in his soul. He
      could not name it, but it seemed to him as something like a grudge against
      someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd in the harbour blended into a close, dark and dead spot,
      faceless, formless, motionless. Foma went away from the rail and began to
      pace the deck gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passengers, conversing aloud, seated themselves to drink tea; the
      porters bustled about on the gallery, setting the tables; somewhere below,
      on the stern, in the third class, a child was crying, a harmonica was
      wailing, the cook was chopping something with knives, the dishes were
      jarring&mdash;producing a rather harsh noise. Cutting the waves and making
      foam, shuddering under the strain and sighing heavily, the enormous
      steamer moved rapidly against the current. Foma looked at the wide strip
      of broken, struggling, and enraged waves at the stern of the steamer, and
      began to feel a wild desire to break or tear something; also to go, breast
      foremost, against the current and to mass its pressure against himself,
      against his breast and his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fate!&rdquo; said someone beside him in a hoarse and weary voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This word was familiar to him: his Aunt Anfisa had often used it as an
      answer to his questions, and he had invested in this brief word a
      conception of a power, similar to the power of God. He glanced at the
      speakers: one of them was a gray little old man, with a kind face; the
      other was younger, with big, weary eyes and with a little black
      wedge-shaped beard. His big gristly nose and his yellow, sunken cheeks
      reminded Foma of his godfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fate!&rdquo; The old man repeated the exclamation of his interlocutor with
      confidence, and began to smile. &ldquo;Fate in life is like a fisherman on the
      river: it throws a baited hook toward us into the tumult of our life and
      we dart at it with greedy mouths. Then fate pulls up the rod&mdash;and the
      man is struggling, flopping on the ground, and then you see his heart is
      broken. That&rsquo;s how it is, my dear man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma closed his eyes, as if a ray of the sun had fallen full on them, and
      shaking his head, he said aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True! That is true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The companions looked at him fixedly: the old man, with a fine, wise
      smile; the large-eyed man, unfriendly, askance. This confused Foma; he
      blushed and walked away, thinking of Fate and wondering why it had first
      treated him kindly by giving him a woman, and then took back the gift from
      him, so simply and abusively? And he now understood that the vague,
      caustic feeling which he carried within him was a grudge against Fate for
      thus sporting with him. He had been too much spoiled by life, to regard
      more plainly the first drop of poison from the cup which was just started,
      and he passed all the time of the journey without sleep, pondering over
      the old man&rsquo;s words and fondling his grudge. This grudge, however, did not
      awaken in him despondency and sorrow, but rather a feeling of anger and
      revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma was met by his godfather, and to his hasty and agitated question,
      Mayakin, his greenish little eyes flashing excitedly, said when he seated
      himself in the carriage beside his godson:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father has grown childish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drinking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worse&mdash;he has lost his mind completely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Oh Lord! Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand? A certain lady is always around him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about her?&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, recalling his Pelageya, and for some
      reason or other his heart was filled with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She sticks to him and&mdash;bleeds him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she a quiet one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She? Quiet as a fire. Seventy-five thousand roubles she blew out of his
      pocket like a feather!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sonka Medinskaya, the architect&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God! Is it possible that she&mdash;Did my father&mdash;Is it
      possible that he took her as his sweetheart?&rdquo; asked Foma, with
      astonishment, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      His godfather drew back from him, and comically opening his eyes wide,
      said convincedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are out of your mind, too! By God, you&rsquo;re out of your mind! Come to
      your senses! A sweetheart at the age of sixty-three! And at such a price
      as this. What are you talking about? Well, I&rsquo;ll tell this to Ignat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mayakin filled the air with a jarring, hasty laughter, at which his
      goat-like beard began to tremble in an uncomely manner. It took Foma a
      long time to obtain a categorical answer; the old man, contrary to his
      habit, was restless and irritated; his speech, usually fluent, was now
      interrupted; he was swearing and expectorating as he spoke, and it was
      with difficulty that Foma learned what the matter was. Sophya Pavlovna
      Medinskaya, the wealthy architect&rsquo;s wife, who was well known in the city
      for her tireless efforts in the line of arranging various charitable
      projects, persuaded Ignat to endow seventy-five thousand roubles for the
      erection of a lodging-house in the city and of a public library with a
      reading-room. Ignat had given the money, and already the newspapers lauded
      him for his generosity. Foma had seen the woman more than once on the
      streets; she was short; he knew that she was considered as one of the most
      beautiful women in the city, and that bad rumours were afoot as to her
      behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, when his godfather concluded the story.
      &ldquo;And I thought God knows what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? You thought?&rdquo; cried Mayakin, suddenly grown angry. &ldquo;You thought
      nothing, you beardless youngster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you abuse me?&rdquo; Foma said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, in your opinion, is seventy-five thousand roubles a big sum or
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a big sum,&rdquo; said Foma, after a moment&rsquo;s thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my father has much money. Why do you make such a fuss about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yakov Tarasovich was taken aback. He looked into the youth&rsquo;s face with
      contempt and asked him in a faint voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you speak like this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Who then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie! It is your young foolishness that speaks. Yes! And my old
      foolishness&mdash;brought to test a million times by life&mdash;says that
      you are a young dog as yet, and it is too early for you to bark in a
      basso.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma hearing this, had often been quite provoked by his godfather&rsquo;s too
      picturesque language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin always spoke to him more roughly than his father, but now the
      youth felt very much offended by the old man and said to him reservedly,
      but firmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better not abuse me without reflection, for I am no longer a
      small child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; exclaimed Mayakin, mockingly lifting his eyebrows and
      squinting.
    </p>
    <p>
      This roused Foma&rsquo;s indignation. He looked full into the old man&rsquo;s eyes and
      articulated with emphasis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am telling you that I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more of that
      undeserved abuse of yours. Enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm! So-o! Pardon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yakov Tarasovich closed his eyes, chewed a little with his lips, and,
      turning aside from his godson, kept silent for awhile. The carriage turned
      into a narrow street, and, noticing from afar the roof of his house, Foma
      involuntarily moved forward. At the same time Mayakin asked him with a
      roguish and gentle smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foma! Tell me&mdash;on whom you have sharpened your teeth? Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, are they sharp?&rdquo; asked Foma, pleased with the manner in which
      Mayakin now regarded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty good. That&rsquo;s good, dear. That&rsquo;s very good! Your father and I were
      afraid lest you should be a laggard. Well, have you learned to drink
      vodka?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drank it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather too soon! Did you drink much of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it taste good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So. Never mind, all this is not so bad. Only you are too outspoken. You
      are ready to confess all your sins to each and every pope that comes
      along. You must consider it isn&rsquo;t always necessary to do that. Sometimes
      by keeping silent you both please people and commit no sins. Yes. A man&rsquo;s
      tongue is very seldom sober. Here we are. See, your father does not know
      that you have arrived. Is he home yet, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was at home: his loud, somewhat hoarse laughter was heard from the open
      windows of the rooms. The noise of the carriage, which stopped at the
      house, caused Ignat to look out of the window, and at the sight of his son
      he cried out with joy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a while he pressed Foma to his breast with one hand, and, pressing
      the palm of his other hand against his son&rsquo;s forehead, thus bending his
      head back, he looked into his face with beaming eyes and spoke
      contentedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sunburnt. You&rsquo;ve grown strong. You&rsquo;re a fine fellow! Madame!
      How&rsquo;s my son? Isn&rsquo;t he fine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad looking,&rdquo; a gentle, silver voice was heard. Foma glanced from
      behind his father&rsquo;s shoulder and noticed that a slender woman with
      magnificent fair hair was sitting in the front corner of the room, resting
      her elbows on the table; her dark eyes, her thin eyebrows and plump, red
      lips strikingly defined on her pale face. Behind her armchair stood a
      large philodendron-plant whose big, figured leaves were hanging down in
      the air over her little golden head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Sophya Pavlovna,&rdquo; said Mayakin, tenderly, approaching her
      with his hand outstretched. &ldquo;What, are you still collecting contributions
      from poor people like us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma bowed to her mutely, not hearing her answer to Mayakin, nor what his
      father was saying to him. The lady stared at him steadfastly and smiled to
      him affably and serenely. Her childlike figure, clothed in some kind of
      dark fabric, was almost blended with the crimson stuff of the armchair,
      while her wavy, golden hair and her pale face shone against the dark
      background. Sitting there in the corner, beneath the green leaves, she
      looked at once like a flower, and like an ikon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, Sophya Pavlovna, how he is staring at you. An eagle, eh?&rdquo; said
      Ignat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes became narrower, a faint blush leaped to her cheeks, and she
      burst into laughter. It sounded like the tinkling of a little silver bell.
      And she immediately arose, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t disturb you. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she went past Foma noiselessly, the scent of perfume came to him, and
      he noticed that her eyes were dark blue, and her eyebrows almost black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sly rogue glided away,&rdquo; said Mayakin in a low voice, angrily looking
      after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell us how was the trip? Have you squandered much money?&rdquo; roared
      Ignat, pushing his son into the same armchair where Medinskaya had been
      sitting awhile before. Foma looked at him askance and seated himself in
      another chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she a beautiful young woman, eh?&rdquo; said Mayakin, smiling, feeling
      Foma with his cunning eyes. &ldquo;If you keep on gaping at her she will eat
      away all your insides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma shuddered for some reason or other, and, saying nothing in reply,
      began to tell his father about the journey in a matter-of-fact tone. But
      Ignat interrupted him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll ask for some cognac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are keeping on drinking all the time, they say,&rdquo; said Foma,
      disapprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignat glanced at his son with surprise and curiosity, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the way to speak to your father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma became confused and lowered his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said Ignat, kind-heartedly, and ordered cognac to be brought
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin, winking his eyes, looked at the Gordyeeffs, sighed, bid them
      good-bye, and, after inviting them to have tea with him in his raspberry
      garden in the evening, went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Aunt Anfisa?&rdquo; asked Foma, feeling that now, being alone with his
      father, he was somewhat ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went to the cloister. Well, tell me, and I will have some cognac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma told his father all about his affairs in a few minutes and he
      concluded his story with a frank confession:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have spent much money on myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About six hundred roubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In six weeks! That&rsquo;s a good deal. I see as a clerk you&rsquo;re too expensive
      for me. Where have you squandered it all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave away three hundred puds of grain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom? How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma told him all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! Well, that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; Ignat approved. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s to show what stuff
      we are made of. That&rsquo;s clear enough&mdash;for the father&rsquo;s honour&mdash;for
      the honour of the firm. And there is no loss either, because that gives a
      good reputation. And that, my dear, is the very best signboard for a
      business. Well, what else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, I somehow spent more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak frankly. It&rsquo;s not the money that I am asking you about&mdash;I just
      want to know how you lived there,&rdquo; insisted Ignat, regarding his son
      attentively and sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was eating, drinking.&rdquo; Foma did not give in, bending his head morosely
      and confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drinking vodka?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vodka, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! So. Isn&rsquo;t it rather too soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Yefim whether I ever drank enough to be intoxicated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I ask Yefim? You must tell me everything yourself. So you are
      drinking? I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can get along without drinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come! Do you want some cognac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma looked at his father and smiled broadly. And his father answered him
      with a kindly smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you. Devil! Drink, but look out&mdash;know your business. What can
      you do? A drunkard will sleep himself sober, a fool&mdash;never. Let us
      understand this much at least, for our own consolation. And did you have a
      good time with girls, too? Be frank! Are you afraid that I will beat you,
      or what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There was one on the steamer. I had her there from Perm to Kazan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; Ignat sighed heavily and said, frowning: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve become defiled
      rather too soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am twenty years old. And you yourself told me that in your days fellows
      married at the age of fifteen,&rdquo; replied Foma, confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then they married. Very well, then, let us drop the subject. Well, you&rsquo;ve
      had dealings with a woman. What of it? A woman is like vaccination, you
      cannot pass your life without her. As for myself, I cannot play the
      hypocrite. I began to go around with women when I was younger than you are
      now. But you must be on your guard with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ignat became pensive and was silent for a long time, sitting motionless,
      his head bent low on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, Foma,&rdquo; he started again, sternly and firmly. &ldquo;I shall die before
      long. I am old. Something oppresses my breast. I breathe with difficulty.
      I&rsquo;ll die. Then all my affairs will fall on your shoulders. At first your
      godfather will assist you&mdash;mind him! You started quite well; you
      attended to everything properly; you held the reins firmly in your hands.
      And though you did squander a big sum of money, it is evident that you did
      not lose your head. God grant the same in the future. You should know
      this: business is a living, strong beast; you must manage it ably; you
      must put a strong bridle on it or it will conquer you. Try to stand above
      your business. Place yourself so that it will all be under your feet; that
      each little tack shall be visible to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma looked at his father&rsquo;s broad chest, heard his heavy voice and thought
      to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you won&rsquo;t die so soon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This thought pleased him and awakened in him a kind, warm feeling for his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rely upon your godfather. He has enough common sense in his head to
      supply the whole town with it. All he lacks is courage, or he would have
      risen high. Yes, I tell you my days on earth are numbered. Indeed, it is
      high time to prepare myself for death; to cast everything aside; to fast,
      and see to it that people bear me good-will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will!&rdquo; said Foma with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were but a reason why they should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the lodging-house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ignat looked at his son and began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yakov has had time to tell it to you already! The old miser. He must have
      abused me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little.&rdquo; Foma smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! Don&rsquo;t I know him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke of it as though it were his own money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ignat leaned back in his chair and burst into still louder laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old raven, eh? That&rsquo;s quite true. Whether it be his own money or
      mine, it is all the same to him. There he is trembling now. He has an aim
      in view, the bald-headed fellow. Can you tell me what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma thought awhile and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you&rsquo;re stupid. He wants to tell our fortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come now, guess!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma looked at his father and&mdash;guessed it. His face became gloomy, he
      slightly raised himself from the armchair and said resolutely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want to. I shall not marry her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh? Why so? She is a strong girl; she is not foolish; she&rsquo;s his only
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Taras? The lost one? But I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lost one is gone, consequently it is not worthwhile speaking of him.
      There is a will, dear, which says: &lsquo;All my movable and real estates shall
      go to my daughter, Lubov.&rsquo; And as to the fact that she is your godfather&rsquo;s
      daughter, we&rsquo;ll set this right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all the same,&rdquo; said Foma, firmly. &ldquo;I shall not marry her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is rather early to speak of it now! But why do you dislike her
      so much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not like such as she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So-o! Just think of it! And which women are more to your liking, sir, may
      I ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those that are more simple. She&rsquo;s always busy with her Gymnasium students
      and with her books. She&rsquo;s become learned. She&rsquo;ll be laughing at my
      expense,&rdquo; said Foma, emotionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite true. She is too bold. But that is a trifle. All sorts of
      rust can be removed if you try to do it. That&rsquo;s a matter for the future.
      And your godfather is a clever old man. His was a peaceful, sedentary
      life; sitting in one place he gave a thought to everything. It is
      worthwhile listening to him, for he can see the wrong side of each and
      every worldly affair. He is our aristocrat&mdash;descending from Mother
      Yekaterina&mdash;ha, ha! He understands a great deal about himself. And as
      his stem was cut off by Taras, he decided to put you in Taras&rsquo;s place, do
      you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;d rather select my place myself,&rdquo; said Foma, stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are foolish as yet.&rdquo; Ignat smiled in reply to his son&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Aunt Anfisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foma! You&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; she cried out, somewhere behind the doors. Foma rose
      and went to meet her, with a gentle smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again his life streamed on slowly, calmly, monotonously. Again the
      Exchange and his father&rsquo;s instructions. Retaining a kindly sarcastic and
      encouraging tone in his relation toward his son, Ignat began to treat him
      more strictly. He censured him for each and every trifle and constantly
      reminded him that he brought him up freely; that he was never in his way
      and that he never beat him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other fathers beat fellows like yourself with logs of wood. And I never
      even touched you with a finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently I didn&rsquo;t deserve it,&rdquo; said Foma one day, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignat became angry at his son for these words and for the tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk so much!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve picked up courage because of the
      softness of my hand. You find an answer to every word I say. Beware;
      though my hand was soft, it can nevertheless still squeeze you so that
      tears will gush forth from your heels. You&rsquo;ve grown up too soon, like a
      toad-stool, just sprung up from the ground. You have a bad smell already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so angry at me?&rdquo; asked Foma, perplexed and offended, when his
      father chanced to be in a happy frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you cannot tolerate it when your father grumbles at you. You&rsquo;re
      ready to quarrel immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is offensive. I have not grown worse than I was before. Don&rsquo;t I
      see how others live at my age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your head wouldn&rsquo;t fall off from my scolding you. And I scold you because
      I see there is something in you that is not mine. What it is, I do not
      know, but I see it is there. And that something is harmful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words of Ignat made the son very thoughtful. Foma also felt
      something strange in himself, something which distinguished him from the
      youth of his age, but he, too, could not understand what it was. And he
      looked at himself with suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma liked to be on the Exchange amid the bustle and talk of the sedate
      people who were making deals amounting to thousands of roubles; the
      respect with which the less well-to-do tradesmen greeted and spoke to him&mdash;to
      Foma, the son of the millionaire&mdash;flattered him greatly. He felt
      happy and proud whenever he successfully managed some part of his father&rsquo;s
      business, assuming all responsibility on his own shoulders, and received a
      smile of approval from his father for it. There was in him a great deal of
      ambition, yearning to appear as a grown-up man of business, but&mdash;just
      as before his trip to Perm&mdash;he lived as in solitude; he still felt no
      longing for friends, although he now came in contact everyday with the
      merchants&rsquo; sons of his age. They had invited him more than once to join
      them in their sprees, but he rather rudely and disdainfully declined their
      invitations and even laughed at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid. Your fathers may learn of your sprees, and as they&rsquo;ll give
      you a drubbing, I might also come in for a share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What he did not like in them was that they were leading a dissipated and
      depraved life, without their fathers&rsquo; knowledge, and that the money they
      were spending was either stolen from their parents or borrowed on
      long-termed promissory notes, to be paid with exorbitant interest. They in
      turn did not like him for this very reserve and aversion, which contained
      the pride so offensive to them. He was timid about speaking to people
      older than himself, fearing lest he should appear in their eyes stupid and
      thick-headed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He often recalled Pelageya, and at first he felt melancholy whenever her
      image flashed before his imagination. But time went on, and little by
      little rubbed off the bright colours of this woman; and before he was
      aware of it his thoughts were occupied by the slender, angel-like
      Medinskaya. She used to come up to Ignat almost every Sunday with various
      requests, all of which generally had but one aim&mdash;to hasten the
      building of the lodging-asylum. In her presence Foma felt awkward, huge,
      heavy; this pained him, and he blushed deeply under the endearing look of
      Sophya Pavlovna&rsquo;s large eyes. He noticed that every time she looked at
      him, her eyes would grow darker, while her upper lip would tremble and
      raise itself slightly, thus displaying very small white teeth. This always
      frightened him. When his father noticed how steadfastly he was staring at
      Medinskaya he told him one day:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be staring so much at that face. Look out, she is like a birch
      ember: from the outside it is just as modest, smooth and dark&mdash;altogether
      cold to all appearances&mdash;but take it into your hand and it will burn
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Medinskaya did not kindle in the youth any sensual passion, for there was
      nothing in her that resembled Pelageya, and altogether she was not at all
      like other women. He knew that shameful rumours about her were in the air,
      but he did not believe any of them. But his relations to her were changed
      when he noticed her one day in a carriage beside a stout man in a gray hat
      and with long hair falling over his shoulders. His face was like a bladder&mdash;red
      and bloated; he had neither moustache nor beard, and altogether he looked
      like a woman in disguise. Foma was told that this was her husband. Then
      dark and contradicting feelings sprang up within him: he felt like
      insulting the architect, and at the same time he envied and respected him.
      Medinskaya now seemed to him less beautiful and more accessible; he began
      to feel sorry for her, and yet he thought malignantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must surely feel disgusted when he kisses her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And after all this he sometimes perceived in himself some bottomless and
      oppressive emptiness, which could not be filled up by anything&mdash;neither
      by the impressions of the day just gone by nor by the recollection of the
      past; and the Exchange, and his affairs, and his thoughts of Medinskaya&mdash;all
      were swallowed up by this emptiness. It alarmed him: in the dark depth of
      this emptiness he suspected some hidden existence of a hostile power, as
      yet formless but already carefully and persistently striving to become
      incarnate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Ignat, changing but little outwardly, was growing ever
      more restless and querulous and was complaining more often of being ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lost my sleep. It used to be so sound that even though you had torn off
      my skin, I would not have felt it. While now I toss about from side to
      side, and I fall asleep only toward morning. And every now and then I
      awaken. My heart beats unevenly, now, though tired out; often thus:
      tuk-tuk-tuk. And sometimes it sinks of a sudden&mdash;and it seems as
      though it would soon tear itself away and fall somewhere into the deep;
      into the bosom. Oh Lord, have pity upon me through Thy great mercy.&rdquo; And
      heaving a penitent sigh, he would lift heavenward his stern eyes, grown
      dim now, devoid of their bright, sparkling glitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Death keeps an eye on me somewhere close by,&rdquo; he said one day morosely,
      but humbly. And indeed, it soon felled his big, sturdy body to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happened in August, early in the morning. Foma was sound asleep when
      suddenly he felt somebody shaking him by the shoulder, and a hoarse voice
      called at his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened his eyes and saw that his father was seated in a chair near his
      bed, monotonously repeating in a dull voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up, get up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun had just risen, and its light, falling on Ignat&rsquo;s white linen
      shirt, had not yet lost its rosy tints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s early,&rdquo; said Foma, stretching himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll sleep enough later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lazily muffling himself in the blanket, Foma asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you need me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up, dear, will you, please?&rdquo; exclaimed Ignat, adding, somewhat
      offended: &ldquo;It must be necessary, since I am waking you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Foma looked closely at his father&rsquo;s face, he noticed that it was gray
      and weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Slightly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we send for a doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take him!&rdquo; Ignat waved his hand. &ldquo;I am not a young man any
      longer. I know it as well without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know it!&rdquo; said the old man, mysteriously, casting a strange glance
      around the room. Foma was dressing himself, and his father, with lowered
      head, spoke slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid to breathe. Something tells me that if I should now heave a
      deep sigh, my heart would burst. Today is Sunday! After the morning mass
      is over, send for the priest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about, papa?&rdquo; Foma smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Wash yourself and go into the garden. I ordered the samovar to
      be brought there. We&rsquo;ll drink our tea in the morning coolness. I feel like
      drinking now hot, strong tea. Be quicker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man rose with difficulty from the chair, and, bent and barefooted,
      left the room in a staggering gait. Foma looked at his father, and a
      shooting chill of fear made his heart shrink. He washed himself in haste,
      and hurried out into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, under an old, spreading apple-tree sat Ignat in a big oaken
      armchair. The light of the sun fell in thin stripes through the branches
      of the trees upon the white figure of the old man clad in his
      night-garments. There was such a profound silence in the garden that even
      the rustle of a branch, accidentally touched by Foma&rsquo;s clothes, seemed to
      him like a loud sound and he shuddered. On the table, before his father,
      stood the samovar, purring like a well-fed tom-cat and exhaling a stream
      of steam into the air. Amid the silence and the fresh verdure of the
      garden, which had been washed by abundant rains the day before, this
      bright spot of the boldly shining, loud brass seemed to Foma as something
      unnecessary, as something which suited neither the time nor the place&mdash;nor
      the feeling that sprang up within him at the sight of the sickly, bent old
      man, who was dressed in white, and who sat alone underneath the mute,
      motionless, dark-green foliage, wherein red apples were modestly peeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be seated,&rdquo; said Ignat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to send for a doctor.&rdquo; Foma advised him irresolutely, seating
      himself opposite him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t necessary. It&rsquo;s a little better now in the open air. And now
      I&rsquo;ll sip some tea and perhaps that will do me more good,&rdquo; said Ignat,
      pouring out tea into the glasses, and Foma noticed that the teapot was
      trembling in his father&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silently moving up one glass for himself, Foma bent over it, blowing the
      foam off the surface of the tea, and with pain in his heart, hearing the
      loud, heavy breathing of his father. Suddenly something struck against the
      table with such force that the dishes began to rattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma shuddered, threw up his head and met the frightened, almost senseless
      look of his father&rsquo;s eyes. Ignat stared at his son and whispered hoarsely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An apple fell down (the devil take it!). It sounded like the firing of a
      gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have some cognac in your tea?&rdquo; Foma suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good enough without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They became silent. A flight of finches winged past over the garden,
      scattering a provokingly cheerful twittering in the air. And again the
      ripe beauty of the garden was bathed in solemn silence. The fright was
      still in Ignat&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord, Jesus Christ!&rdquo; said he in a low voice, making the sign of the
      cross. &ldquo;Yes. There it is&mdash;the last hour of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, papa!&rdquo; whispered Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why stop? We&rsquo;ll have our tea, and then send for the priest, and for
      Mayakin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather send for them now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll soon toll for the mass&mdash;the priest isn&rsquo;t home&mdash;and then
      there&rsquo;s no hurry, it may pass soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he noisily started to sip the tea out of the saucer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should live another year or two. You are young, and I am very much
      afraid for you. Live honestly and firmly; do not covet what belongs to
      other people, take good care of your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was hard for him to speak, he stopped short and rubbed his chest with
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not rely upon others; expect but little from them. We all live in
      order to take, not to give. Oh Lord! Have mercy on the sinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the distance the deep sound of the bell fell on the silence
      of the morning. Ignat and Foma crossed themselves three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the first sound of the bell-tone came another, then a third, and
      soon the air was filled with sounds of the church-bells, coming from all
      sides&mdash;flowing, measured, calling aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, they are tolling for the mass,&rdquo; said Ignat, listening to the echo
      of the bell-metal. &ldquo;Can you tell the bells by their sounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just listen. This one now&mdash;do you hear? the bass&mdash;this is from
      the Nikola Church. It was presented by Peter Mitrich Vyagin&mdash;and
      this, the hoarse one&mdash;this is at the church of Praskeva Pyatnitza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The singing waves of the bell-tones agitated the air, which was filled
      with them, and they died away in the clear blue of the sky. Foma stared
      thoughtfully at his father&rsquo;s face and saw that the alarm was disappearing
      from his eyes, and that they were now brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly the old man&rsquo;s face turned very red, his eyes distended and
      rolled out of their orbits, his mouth opened with fright, and from it
      issued a strange, hissing sound:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F-F-A-A-ch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after this Ignat&rsquo;s head fell back on his shoulder, and his
      heavy body slowly slipped down from the chair to the ground as if the
      earth had dragged him imperiously unto itself. Foma was motionless and
      silent for awhile, then he rushed up to Ignat, lifted his head from the
      ground and looked into his face. The face was dark, motionless, and the
      wide-open eyes expressed nothing&mdash;neither pain, nor fear, nor joy.
      Foma looked around him. As before, nobody was in the garden, and the
      resounding chatter of the bells was still roaring in the air. Foma&rsquo;s hands
      began to tremble, he let go his father&rsquo;s head, and it struck heavily
      against the ground. Dark, thick blood began to gush in a narrow stream
      from his open mouth across his blue cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma struck his breast with both hands, and kneeling before the dead body,
      he wildly cried aloud. He was trembling with fright, and with eyes like
      those of a madman he was searching for someone in the verdure of the
      garden.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      HIS father&rsquo;s death stupefied Foma and filled him with a strange sensation;
      quiet was poured into his soul&mdash;a painful, immovable quiet, which
      absorbed all the sounds of life without accounting for it. All sorts of
      acquaintances were bustling about him; they appeared, disappeared, said
      something to him&mdash;his replies to them were untimely, and their words
      called forth no images in him, drowning, without leaving any trace, in the
      bottomless depths of the death-like silence which filled his soul. He
      neither cried, nor grieved, nor thought of anything; pale and gloomy, with
      knitted brow, he was attentively listening to this quiet, which had forced
      out all his feelings, benumbed his heart and tightly clutched his brains.
      He was conscious but of the purely physical sensation of heaviness in all
      his frame and particularly in his breast, and then it also seemed to him
      that it was always twilight, and even though the sun was still high in the
      sky&mdash;everything on earth looked dark and melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The funeral was arranged by Mayakin. Hastily and briskly he was bustling
      about in the rooms, making much clatter with the heels of his boots; he
      cried at the household help imperiously, clapped his godson on the
      shoulder, consoling him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why are you petrified? Roar and you will feel relieved. Your father
      was old&mdash;old in body. Death is prepared for all of us, you cannot
      escape it&mdash;consequently you must not be prematurely torpid. You
      cannot bring him to life again with your sorrow, and your grief is
      unnecessary to him, for it is said: &lsquo;When the body is robbed of the soul
      by the terrible angels, the soul forgets all relatives and acquaintances,&rsquo; 
      which means that you are of no consequence to him now, whether you cry or
      laugh. But the living must care for the living. You had better cry, for
      this is human. It brings much relief to the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But neither did these words provoke anything in Foma&rsquo;s head or in his
      heart. He came to himself, however, on the day of the funeral, thanks to
      the persistence of his godfather, who was assiduously and oddly trying to
      rouse his sad soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of the funeral was cloudy and dreary. Amid a heavy cloud of dust
      an enormous crowd of people, winding like a black ribbon, followed the
      coffin of Ignat Gordyeeff. Here and there flashed the gold of the priest&rsquo;s
      robes, and the dull noise of the slow movement of the crowd blended in
      harmony with the solemn music of the choir, composed of the bishop&rsquo;s
      choristers. Foma was pushed from behind and from the sides; he walked,
      seeing nothing but the gray head of his father, and the mournful singing
      resounded in his heart like a melancholy echo. And Mayakin, walking beside
      him, kept on intrusively whispering in his ears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, what a crowd&mdash;thousands! The governor himself came out to
      accompany your father to the church, the mayor, and almost the entire city
      council. And behind you&mdash;just turn around! There goes Sophya
      Pavlovna. The town pays its respects to Ignat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At first Foma did not listen to his godfather&rsquo;s whisper, but when he
      mentioned Medinskaya, he involuntarily looked back and noticed the
      governor. A little drop of something pleasant fell into his heart at the
      sight of this important personage, with a bright ribbon across his
      shoulder, with orders on his breast, pacing after the coffin, an
      expression of sorrow on his stern countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed is the road where this soul goeth today,&rdquo; Yakov Tarasovich hummed
      softly, moving his nose, and he again whispered in his godson&rsquo;s ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventy-five thousand roubles is such a sum that you can demand so many
      escorts for it. Have you heard that Sonka is making arrangements for the
      laying of the corner-stone on the fifteenth? Just forty days after the
      death of your father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma again turned back, and his eyes met the eyes of Medinskaya. He heaved
      a deep sigh at her caressing glance, and felt relieved at once, as if a
      warm ray of light penetrated his soul and something melted there. And then
      and there he considered that it was unbecoming him to turn his head from
      side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
      At church Foma&rsquo;s head began to ache, and it seemed to him that everything
      around and underneath him was shaking. In the stifling air, filled with
      dust, with the breathing of the people and the smoke of the incense, the
      flames of the candles were timidly trembling. The meek image of Christ
      looked down at him from the big ikon, and the flames of the candles,
      reflected in the tarnished gold of the crown over the Saviour&rsquo;s brow,
      reminded him of drops of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma&rsquo;s awakened soul was greedily feeding itself on the solemn, gloomy
      poetry of the liturgy, and when the touching citation was heard, &ldquo;Come,
      let us give him the last kiss,&rdquo; a loud, wailing sob escaped from Foma&rsquo;s
      chest, and the crowd in church was stirred to agitation by this outburst
      of grief.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Having uttered the sob, Foma staggered. His godfather immediately caught
him by his arms and began to push him forward to the coffin, singing
quite loudly and with some anger:

 &ldquo;Kiss him who was but lately with us.
 Kiss, Foma, kiss him&mdash;he is given over to the grave, covered with a stone.
 He is settling down in darkness, and is buried with the dead.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Foma touched his father&rsquo;s forehead with his lips and sprang back from the
      coffin with horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your peace! You nearly knocked me down,&rdquo; Mayakin remarked to him, in
      a low voice, and these simple, calm words supported Foma better than his
      godfather&rsquo;s hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye that behold me mute and lifeless before you, weep for me, brethren and
      friends,&rdquo; begged Ignat through the mouth of the Church. But his son was
      not crying any longer; his horror was called forth by the black, swollen
      face of his father, and this horror somewhat sobered his soul, which had
      been intoxicated by the mournful music of the Church&rsquo;s lament for its
      sinful son. He was surrounded by acquaintances, who were kindly consoling
      him; he listened to them and understood that they all felt sorry for him
      and that he became dear to them. And his godfather whispered in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, how they all fawn upon you. The tom-cats have smelt the fat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words were unpleasant to Foma, but they were useful to him, as they
      caused him to answer at all events.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the cemetery, when they sang for Ignat&rsquo;s eternal memory, he cried again
      bitterly and loud. His godfather immediately seized him by the arms and
      led him away from the grave, speaking to him earnestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a faint-hearted fellow you are! Do I not feel sorry for him? I have
      known his real value, while you were but his son. And yet, I do not cry.
      For more than thirty years we lived together in perfect harmony&mdash;how
      much had been spoken, how much thought&mdash;how much sorrow drunk. You
      are young; it is not for you to grieve! Your life is before you, and you
      will be rich in all sorts of friendship; while I am old, and now that I
      buried my only friend, I am like a pauper. I can no longer make a bosom
      friend!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s voice began to jar and squeak queerly. His face was
      distorted, his lips were stretched into a big grimace and were quivering,
      and from his small eyes frequent tears were running over the now
      contracted wrinkles of his face. He looked so pitiful and so unlike
      himself, that Foma stopped short, pressed him close to his body with the
      tenderness of a strong man and cried with alarm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, father&mdash;darling! Don&rsquo;t cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have it!&rdquo; said Mayakin, faintly, and, heaving a deep sigh, he
      suddenly turned again into a firm and clever old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not cry,&rdquo; said he, mysteriously, seating himself in the carriage
      beside his godson. &ldquo;You are now the commander-in-chief in the war and you
      must command your soldiers bravely. Your soldiers are the roubles, and you
      have a great army of these. Make war incessantly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Surprised at the quickness of his transformation, Foma listened to his
      words and for some reason or other they reminded him of those clods of
      earth, which the people threw into Ignat&rsquo;s grave upon his coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On whom am I to make war?&rdquo; said Foma with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you that! Did your father tell you that I was a clever old man
      and that you should mind me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do mind me! If my mind should be added to your youthful strength, a
      good victory might be won. Your father was a great man, but he did not
      look far before him and he could not take my advice. He gained success in
      life not with his mind, but more with his head. Oh, what will become of
      you? You had better move into my house, for you will feel lonesome in
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt? She is sick. She will not live long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not speak of it,&rdquo; begged Foma in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I will speak of it. You need not fear death&mdash;you are not an old
      woman on the oven. Live fearlessly and do what you were appointed to do.
      Man is appointed for the organisation of life on earth. Man is capital&mdash;like
      a rouble, he is made up of trashy copper groshes and copecks. From the
      dust of the earth, as it is said; and even as he has intercourse with the
      world, he absorbs grease and oil, sweat and tears&mdash;a soul and a mind
      form themselves in him. And from this he starts to grow upward and
      downward. Now, you see his price is a grosh, now a fifteen copeck silver
      piece, now a hundred roubles, and sometimes he is above any price. He is
      put into circulation and he must bring interests to life. Life knows the
      value of each of us and will not check our course before time. Nobody,
      dear, works to his own detriment, if he is wise. And life has saved up
      much wisdom. Are you listening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are probably lying?&rdquo; Mayakin doubted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, why must we die?&rdquo; asked Foma in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin looked into his face with regret, smacked his lips and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wise man would never ask such a question. A wise man knows for himself
      that if it is a river, it must be flowing somewhere, and if it were
      standing in one place, it would be a swamp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re simply mocking me at random,&rdquo; said Foma, sternly. &ldquo;The sea is not
      flowing anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sea receives all rivers into itself, and then, powerful storms rage
      in it at times. Then the sea of life also submits on agitation, stirred up
      by men, and death renovates the waters of the sea of life, that they might
      not become spoiled. No matter how many people are dying, they are
      nevertheless forever growing in number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it? But my father is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will die as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what have I to do with the fact that people are growing in number?&rdquo;
       Foma smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, he, he!&rdquo; sighed Mayakin. &ldquo;That, indeed, concerns none of us. There,
      your trousers probably reason in the same way: what have we to do with the
      fact that there are all sorts of stuff in the world? But you do not mind
      them&mdash;you wear them out and throw them away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma glanced at his godfather reproachfully, and noticing that the old man
      was smiling, he was astonished and he asked respectfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be true, father, that you do not fear death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of all I fear foolishness, my child,&rdquo; replied Mayakin with humble
      bitterness. &ldquo;My opinion is this: if a fool give you honey, spit upon it;
      if a wise man give you poison, drink it! And I will tell you that the
      perch has a weak soul since his fins do not stand on end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s mocking words offended and angered Foma. He turned aside and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can never speak without these subterfuges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot!&rdquo; exclaimed Mayakin, and his eyes began to sparkle with alarm.
      &ldquo;Each man uses the very same tongue he has. Do I seem to be stern? Do I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you. Know this&mdash;he loves who teaches. Remember this well. And as
      to death, do not think of it. It is foolish, dear, for a live man to think
      of death. &lsquo;Ecclesiastes&rsquo; reflected on death better than anybody else
      reflected on it, and said that a living dog is better than a dead lion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They came home. The street near the house was crowded with carriages, and
      from the open windows came loud sounds of talk. As soon as Foma appeared
      in the hall, he was seized by the arms and led away to the table and there
      was urged to drink and eat something. A marketplace noise smote the air;
      the hall was crowded and suffocating. Silently, Foma drank a glass of
      vodka, then another, and a third. Around him they were munching and
      smacking their lips; the vodka poured out from the bottles was gurgling,
      the wine-glasses were tinkling. They were speaking of dried sturgeon and
      of the bass of the soloist of the bishop&rsquo;s choir, and then again of the
      dried sturgeon, and then they said that the mayor also wished to make a
      speech, but did not venture to do so after the bishop had spoken, fearing
      lest he should not speak so well as the bishop. Someone was telling with
      feeling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The deceased one used to do thus: he would cut off a slice of salmon,
      pepper it thickly, cover it with another slice of salmon, and then send it
      down immediately after a drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us follow his example,&rdquo; roared a thick basso. Offended to the quick,
      Foma looked with a frown at the fat lips and at the jaws chewing the tasty
      food, and he felt like crying out and driving away all these people, whose
      sedateness had but lately inspired him with respect for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better be more kind, more sociable,&rdquo; said Mayakin in a low voice,
      coming up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are they gobbling here? Is this a tavern?&rdquo; cried Foma, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; Mayakin remarked with fright and hastily turned to look around
      with a kind smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was too late; his smile was of no avail. Foma&rsquo;s words had been
      overheard, the noise and the talk was subsiding, some of the guests began
      to bustle about hurriedly, others, offended, frowned, put down their forks
      and knives and walked away from the table, all looking at Foma askance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silent and angry, he met these glances without lowering his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ask you to come up to the table!&rdquo; cried Mayakin, gleaming amid the
      crowd of people like an ember amid ashes. &ldquo;Be seated, pray! They&rsquo;re soon
      serving pancakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma shrugged his shoulders and walked off toward the door, saying aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard a hostile rumbling behind him and his godfather&rsquo;s wheedling voice
      saying to somebody:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for grief. Ignat was at once father and mother to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma came out in the garden and sat down on the same place where his
      father had died. The feeling of loneliness and grief oppressed his heart.
      He unbuttoned the collar of his shirt to make his breathing easier, rested
      his elbows on the table, and with his head tightly pressed between his
      hands, he sat motionless. It was drizzling and the leaves of the
      apple-tree were rustling mournfully under the drops of the rain. He sat
      there for a long time alone, motionless, watching how the small drops were
      falling from the apple-tree. His head was heavy from the vodka, and in his
      heart there was a growing grudge against men. Some indefinite, impersonal
      feelings and thoughts were springing up and vanishing within him; before
      him flashed the bald skull of his godfather with a little crown of silver
      hair and with a dark face, which resembled the faces of the ancient ikons.
      This face with the toothless mouth and the malicious smile, rousing in
      Foma hatred and fear, augmented in him the consciousness of solitude. Then
      he recalled the kind eyes of Medinskaya and her small, graceful figure;
      and beside her arose the tall, robust, and rosy-cheeked Lubov Mayakina
      with smiling eyes and with a big light golden-coloured braid. &ldquo;Do not rely
      upon men, expect but little at their hands&rdquo;&mdash;his father&rsquo;s words began
      to ring in his memory. He sighed sadly and cast a glance around him. The
      tree leaves were fluttering from the rain, and the air was full of
      mournful sounds. The gray sky seemed as though weeping, and on the trees
      cold tears were trembling. And Foma&rsquo;s soul was dry, dark; it was filled
      with a painful feeling of orphanhood. But this feeling gave birth to the
      question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How shall I live now that I am alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rain drenched his clothes, and when he felt that he was shivering with
      cold he arose and went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was tugging him from all sides, giving him no chance to be
      concentrated in thinking of and grieving for his father, and on the
      fortieth day after Ignat&rsquo;s death Foma, attired in holiday clothes, with a
      pleasant feeling in his heart, went to the ceremony of the corner-stone
      laying of the lodging-asylum. Medinskaya notified him in a letter the day
      before, that he had been elected as a member of the building committee and
      also as honorary member of the society of which she was president. This
      pleased him and he was greatly agitated by the part he was to play today
      at the laying of the corner-stone. On his way he thought of how everything
      would be and how he should behave in order not to be confused before the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, eh! Hold on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned around. Mayakin came hastening to him from the sidewalk. He was
      in a frock-coat that reached his heels, in a high cap, and he carried a
      huge umbrella in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, take me up there,&rdquo; said the old man, cleverly jumping into the
      carriage like a monkey. &ldquo;To tell the truth, I was waiting for you. I was
      looking around, thinking it was time for you to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going there?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! I must see how they will bury my friend&rsquo;s money in the
      ground.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma looked at him askance and was silent. &ldquo;Why do you frown upon me?
      Don&rsquo;t fear, you will also start out as a benefactor among men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Foma, reservedly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read in the newspaper
      this morning that you were elected as a member of the building committee
      and also as an honorary member of Sophya&rsquo;s society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This membership will eat into your pocket!&rdquo; sighed Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t ruin me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; observed the old man, maliciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak of this more because there is altogether very little wisdom in
      this charity business, and I may even say that it isn&rsquo;t a business at all,
      but simply harmful nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it harmful to aid people?&rdquo; asked Foma, hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you cabbage head!&rdquo; said Mayakin with a smile. &ldquo;You had better come up
      to my house, I&rsquo;ll open your eyes in regard to this. I must teach you! Will
      you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will come!&rdquo; replied Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So. And in the meantime, hold yourself proud at the laying of the
      corner-stone. Stand in view of everybody. If I don&rsquo;t tell this to you, you
      might hide yourself behind somebody&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I hide myself?&rdquo; said Foma, displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I say: there is no reason why. For the money was donated
      by your father and you are entitled to the honour as his heir. Honour is
      just the same as money. With honour a business man will get credit
      everywhere, and everywhere there is a way open to him. Then come forward,
      so that everybody may see you and that if you do five copecks&rsquo; worth of
      work, you should get a rouble in return for it. And if you will hide
      yourself&mdash;nothing but foolishness will be the result.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at their destination, where all the important people had
      gathered already, and an enormous crowd of people surrounded the piles of
      wood, bricks and earth. The bishop, the governor, the representatives of
      the city&rsquo;s aristocracy and the administration formed, together with the
      splendidly dressed ladies, a big bright group and looked at the efforts of
      the two stonemasons, who were preparing the bricks and the lime. Mayakin
      and his godson wended their way toward this group. He whispered to Foma:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lose no courage, these people have robbed their bellies to cover
      themselves with silk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he greeted the governor before the bishop, in a respectfully cheerful
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, your Excellency? Give me your blessing, your Holiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Yakov Tarasovich!&rdquo; exclaimed the governor with a friendly smile,
      shaking and squeezing Mayakin&rsquo;s hand, while the old man was at the same
      time kissing the bishop&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;How are you, deathless old man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you humbly, your Excellency! My respects to Sophya Pavlovna!&rdquo;
       Mayakin spoke fast, whirling like a peg-top amid the crowd of people. In a
      minute he managed to shake hands with the presiding justice of the court,
      with the prosecutor, with the mayor&mdash;in a word, with all those people
      whom he considered it necessary to greet first; such as these, however,
      were few. He jested, smiled and at once attracted everybody&rsquo;s attention to
      his little figure, and Foma with downcast head stood behind him, looking
      askance at these people wrapped in costly stuffs, embroidered with gold;
      he envied the old man&rsquo;s adroitness and lost his courage, and feeling that
      he was losing his courage&mdash;he grew still more timid. But now Mayakin
      seized him by the hand and drew him up to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, your Excellency, this is my godson, Foma, the late Ignat&rsquo;s only
      son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the governor in his basso, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very pleased. I sympathise with
      you in your misfortune, young man!&rdquo; he said, shaking Foma&rsquo;s hand, and
      became silent; then he added resolutely and confidently: &ldquo;To lose a
      father, that is a very painful misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, having waited about two seconds for Foma&rsquo;s answer, he turned away
      from him, addressing Mayakin approvingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted with the speech you made yesterday in the city hall!
      Beautiful, clever, Yakov Tarasovich. Proposing to use the money for this
      public club, they do not understand the real needs of the population.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then, your Excellency, a small capital means that the city will have
      to add its own money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly true! Perfectly true!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Temperance, I say, is good! Would to God that all were sober! I don&rsquo;t
      drink, either, but what is the use of these performances, libraries and
      all that, since the people cannot even read?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The governor replied approvingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, I say, you better use this money for a technical institution. If it
      should be established on a small plan, this money alone will suffice, and
      in case it shouldn&rsquo;t, we can ask for more in St. Petersburg&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
      give it to us. Then the city wouldn&rsquo;t have to add of its own money, and
      the whole affair would be more sensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely! I fully agree with you! But how the liberals began to cry at
      you! Eh? Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That has always been their business, to cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deep cough of the archdeacon of the cathedral announced the beginning
      of the divine service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophya Pavlovna came up to Foma, greeted him and said in a sad, low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I looked at your face on the day of the funeral, and my heart saddened.
      My God, I thought, how he must suffer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Foma listened to her and felt as though he was drinking honey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These cries of yours, they shook my soul, my poor child! I may speak to
      you this way, for I am an old woman already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo; she asked, naively looking into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma was silent, his head bent on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe that I am an old woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you; that is, I believe everything you may say; only this is
      not true!&rdquo; said Foma, feelingly, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is not true? What do you believe me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! not this, but that. I&mdash;excuse me! I cannot speak!&rdquo; said Foma,
      sadly, all aflush with confusion. &ldquo;I am not cultured.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not trouble yourself on this account,&rdquo; said Medinskaya,
      patronisingly. &ldquo;You are so young, and education is accessible to
      everybody. But there are people to whom education is not only unnecessary,
      but who can also be harmed by it. Those that are pure of heart, sanguine,
      sincere, like children, and you are of those people. You are, are you
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What could Foma say in answer to this question? He said sincerely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you humbly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And noticing that his words called forth a gay gleam in Medinskaya&rsquo;s eyes,
      Foma appeared ridiculous and stupid in his own eyes; he immediately became
      angry at himself and said in a muffled voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am such. I always speak my mind. I cannot deceive. If I see
      something to laugh at, I laugh openly. I am stupid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you speak that way?&rdquo; said the woman, reproachfully, and
      adjusting her dress, she accidentally stroked Foma&rsquo;s hand, in which he
      held his hat. This made him look at his wrist and smile joyously and
      confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will surely be present at the dinner, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Medinskaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And tomorrow at the meeting in my house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without fail!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And perhaps sometime you will drop in, simply on a visit, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I thank you! I&rsquo;ll come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must thank you for the promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They became silent. In the air soared the reverently soft voice of the
      bishop, who recited the prayer expressively, outstretching his hand over
      the place where the corner-stone of the house was laid:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May neither the wind, nor water, nor anything else bring harm unto it;
      may it be completed in thy benevolence, and free all those that are to
      live in it from all kinds of calumny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How rich and beautiful our prayers are, are they not?&rdquo; asked Medinskaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Foma, shortly, without understanding her words and feeling
      that he was blushing again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will always be opponents of our commercial interests,&rdquo; Mayakin
      whispered loudly and convincingly, standing beside the city mayor, not far
      from Foma. &ldquo;What is it to them? All they want is somehow to deserve the
      approval of the newspaper. But they cannot reach the main point. They live
      for mere display, not for the organisation of life; these are their only
      measures: the newspapers and Sweden! [Mayakin speaks of Sweden, meaning
      Switzerland.&mdash;Translator&rsquo;s note.] The doctor scoffed at me all day
      yesterday with this Sweden. The public education, says he, in Sweden, and
      everything else there is first-class! But what is Sweden, anyway? It may
      be that Sweden is but a fib, is but used as an example, and that there is
      no education whatever or any of the other things there. And then, we don&rsquo;t
      live for the sake of Sweden, and Sweden cannot put us to test. We have to
      make our lip according to our own last. Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the archdeacon droned, his head thrown back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eternal me-emo-ory to the founder of this ho-ouse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma shuddered, but Mayakin was already by his side, and pulling him by
      the sleeve, asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to the dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Medinskaya&rsquo;s velvet-like, warm little hand glided once more over
      Foma&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was to Foma a real torture. For the first time in his life
      among these uniformed people, he saw that they were eating and speaking&mdash;doing
      everything better than he, and he felt that between him and Medinskaya,
      who was seated just opposite him, was a high mountain, not a table. Beside
      him sat the secretary of the society of which Foma had been made an
      honorary member; he was a young court officer, bearing the odd name of
      Ookhtishchev. As if to make his name appear more absurd than it really
      was, he spoke in a loud, ringing tenor, and altogether&mdash;plump, short,
      round-faced and a lively talker&mdash;he looked like a brand new bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very best thing in our society is the patroness; the most reasonable
      is what we are doing&mdash;courting the patroness; the most difficult is
      to tell the patroness such a compliment as would satisfy her; and the most
      sensible thing is to admire the patroness silently and hopelessly. So that
      in reality, you are a member not of &lsquo;the Society of Solicitude,&rsquo; and so
      on, but of the Society of Tantaluses, which is composed of persons bent on
      pleasing Sophya Medinskaya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma listened to his chatter, now and then looking at the patroness, who
      was absorbed in a conversation with the chief of the police; Foma roared
      in reply to his interlocutor, pretending to be busy eating, and he wished
      that all this would end the sooner. He felt that he was wretched, stupid,
      ridiculous and he was certain that everybody was watching and censuring
      him. This tied him with invisible shackles, thus checking his words and
      his thoughts. At last he went so far, that the line of various
      physiognomies, stretched out by the table opposite him, seemed to him a
      long and wavy white strip besprinkled with laughing eyes, and all these
      eyes were pricking him unpleasantly and painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin sat near the city mayor, waved his fork in the air quickly, and
      kept on talking all the time, now contracting, now expanding the wrinkles
      of his face. The mayor, a gray-headed, red-faced, short-necked man, stared
      at him like a bull, with obstinate attention and at times he rapped on the
      edge of the table with his big finger affirmatively. The animated talk and
      laughter drowned his godfather&rsquo;s bold speech, and Foma was unable to hear
      a single word of it, much more so that the tenor of the secretary was
      unceasingly ringing in his ears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, there, the archdeacon arose; he is filling his lungs with air; he
      will soon proclaim an eternal memory for Ignat Matveyich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I not go away?&rdquo; asked Foma in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? Everybody will understand this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The deacon&rsquo;s resounding voice drowned and seemed to have crushed the noise
      in the hail; the eminent merchants fixed their eyes on the big, wide-open
      mouth, from which a deep sound was streaming forth, and availing himself
      of this moment, Foma arose from his seat and left the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      After awhile he breathed freely and, sitting in his cab, thought sadly
      that there was no place for him amid these people. Inwardly, he called
      them polished. He did not like their brilliancy, their faces, their smiles
      or their words, but the freedom and the cleverness of their movements,
      their ability to speak much and on any subject, their pretty costumes&mdash;all
      this aroused in him a mixture of envy and respect for them. He felt sad
      and oppressed at the consciousness of being unable to talk so much and so
      fluently as all these people, and here he recalled that Luba Mayakina had
      more than once scoffed at him on this account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma did not like Mayakin&rsquo;s daughter, and since he had learned from his
      father of Mayakin&rsquo;s intention to marry him to Luba, the young Gordyeeff
      began to shun her. But after his father&rsquo;s death he was almost every day at
      the Mayakins, and somehow Luba said to him one day:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am looking at you, and, do you know?&mdash;you do not resemble a
      merchant at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor do you look like a merchant&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; said Foma, and looked at her
      suspiciously. He did not understand the meaning of her words; did she mean
      to offend him, or did she say these words without any kind thoughts?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for this!&rdquo; said she and smiled to him a kind, friendly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you so glad?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact that we don&rsquo;t resemble our fathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma glanced at her in astonishment and kept silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me frankly,&rdquo; said she, lowering her voice, &ldquo;you do not love my
      father, do you? You don&rsquo;t like him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; said Foma, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I dislike him very much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For everything. When you grow wiser, you will know it yourself. Your
      father was a better man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; said Foma, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this conversation an attachment sprang up between them almost
      immediately, and growing stronger from day to day, it soon developed into
      friendship, though a somewhat odd friendship it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Luba was not older than her god-brother, she nevertheless treated
      him as an older person would treat a little boy. She spoke to him
      condescendingly, often jesting at his expense; her talk was always full of
      words which were unfamiliar to Foma; and she pronounced these words with
      particular emphasis and with evident satisfaction. She was especially fond
      of speaking about her brother Taras, whom she had never seen, but of whom
      she was telling such stories as would make him look like Aunt Anfisa&rsquo;s
      brave and noble robbers. Often, when complaining of her father, she said
      to Foma:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will also be just such a skinflint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All this was unpleasant to the youth and stung his vanity. But at times
      she was straightforward, simple-minded, and particularly kind and friendly
      to him; then he would unburden his heart before her, and for a long time
      they would share each other&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both spoke a great deal and spoke sincerely, but neither one understood
      the other; it seemed to Foma that whatever Luba had to say was foreign to
      him and unnecessary to her, and at the same time he clearly saw that his
      awkward words did not at all interest her, and that she did not care to
      understand them. No matter how long these conversations lasted, they gave
      both of them the sensation of discomfort and dissatisfaction. As if an
      invisible wall of perplexity had suddenly arisen and stood between them.
      They did not venture to touch this wall, or to tell each other that they
      felt it was there&mdash;they resumed their conversations, dimly conscious
      that there was something in each of them that might bind and unite them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Foma arrived at his godfather&rsquo;s house, he found Luba alone. She came
      out to meet him, and it was evident that she was either ill or out of
      humour; her eyes were flashing feverishly and were surrounded with black
      circles. Feeling cold, she muffled herself in a warm shawl and said with a
      smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good that you&rsquo;ve come! For I was sitting here alone; it is lonesome&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t feel like going anywhere. Will you drink tea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will. What is the matter with you, are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the dining-room, and I&rsquo;ll tell them to bring the samovar,&rdquo; she
      said, not answering his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into one of the small rooms of the house, whose two windows
      overlooked the garden. In the middle of the room stood an oval table,
      surrounded with old-fashioned, leather-covered chairs; on one partition
      hung a clock in a long case with a glass door, in the corner was a
      cupboard for dishes, and opposite the windows, by the walls, was an oaken
      sideboard as big as a fair-sized room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming from the banquet?&rdquo; asked Luba, entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma nodded his head mutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how was it? Grand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was terrible!&rdquo; Foma smiled. &ldquo;I sat there as if on hot coals. They all
      looked there like peacocks, while I looked like a barn-owl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luba was taking out dishes from the cupboard and said nothing to Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, why are you so sad?&rdquo; asked Foma again, glancing at her gloomy
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him and said with enthusiasm and anxiety:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Foma! What a book I&rsquo;ve read! If you could only understand it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be a good book, since it worked you up in this way,&rdquo; said Foma,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not sleep. I read all night long. Just think of it: you read&mdash;and
      it seems to you that the gates of another kingdom are thrown open before
      you. And the people there are different, and their language is different,
      everything different! Life itself is different there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; said Foma, dissatisfied. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all fiction, deceit;
      so is the theatre. The merchants are ridiculed there. Are they really so
      stupid? Of course! Take your father, for example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The theatre and the school are one and the same, Foma,&rdquo; said Luba,
      instructively. &ldquo;The merchants used to be like this. And what deceit can
      there be in books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as in fairy&mdash;tales, nothing is real.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wrong! You have read no books; how can you judge? Books are
      precisely real. They teach you how to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; Foma waved his hand. &ldquo;Drop it; no good will come out of your
      books! There, take your father, for example, does he read books? And yet
      he is clever! I looked at him today and envied him. His relations with
      everybody are so free, so clever, he has a word for each and every one.
      You can see at once that whatever he should desire he is sure to attain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he striving for?&rdquo; exclaimed Luba. &ldquo;Nothing but money. But there
      are people that want happiness for all on earth, and to gain this end they
      work without sparing themselves; they suffer and perish! How can my father
      be compared with these?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not compare them. They evidently like one thing, while your
      father likes another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not like anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How&rsquo;s that?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They want to change everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they do strive for something?&rdquo; said Foma, thoughtfully. &ldquo;They do wish
      for something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wish for happiness for all!&rdquo; cried Luba, hotly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand
      this,&rdquo; said Foma, nodding his head. &ldquo;Who cares there for my happiness? And
      then again, what happiness can they give me, since I, myself, do not know
      as yet what I want? No, you should have rather looked at those that were
      at the banquet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are not men!&rdquo; announced Luba, categorically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what they are in your eyes, but you can see at once that
      they know their place. A clever, easy-going lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Foma!&rdquo; exclaimed Luba, vexed. &ldquo;You understand nothing! Nothing
      agitates you! You are an idler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that&rsquo;s going too far! I&rsquo;ve simply not had time enough to see where I
      am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are simply an empty man,&rdquo; said Luba, resolutely and firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not within my soul,&rdquo; replied Foma, calmly. &ldquo;You cannot know my
      thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there that you should think of?&rdquo; said Luba, shrugging her
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? First of all, I am alone. Secondly, I must live. Don&rsquo;t I understand
      that it is altogether impossible for me to live as I am now? I do not care
      to be made the laughing-stock of others. I cannot even speak to people.
      No, nor can I think.&rdquo; Foma concluded his words and smiled confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is necessary to read, to study,&rdquo; Luba advised him convincingly, pacing
      up and down the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something is stirring within my soul,&rdquo; Foma went on, not looking at her,
      as though speaking to himself; &ldquo;but I cannot tell what it is. I see, for
      instance, that whatever my godfather says is clever and reasonable. But
      that does not attract me. The other people are by far more interesting to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the aristocrats?&rdquo; asked Luba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the place for you!&rdquo; said Luba, with a smile of contempt. &ldquo;Eh,
      you! Are they men? Do they have souls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know them? You are not acquainted with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the books? Have I not read books about them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid brought in the samovar, and the conversation was interrupted.
      Luba made tea in silence while Foma looked at her and thought of
      Medinskaya. He was wishing to have a talk with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the girl, thoughtfully, &ldquo;I am growing more and more convinced
      everyday that it is hard to live. What shall I do? Marry? Whom? Shall I
      marry a merchant who will do nothing but rob people all his life, nothing
      but drink and play cards? A savage? I do not want it! I want to be an
      individual. I am such, for I know how wrong the construction of life is.
      Shall I study? My father will not allow this. Oh Lord! Shall I run away? I
      have not enough courage. What am I to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clasped her hands and bowed her head over the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew but how repulsive everything is. There is not a living soul
      around here. Since my mother died, my father drove everyone away. Some
      went off to study. Lipa, too, left us. She writes me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Read.&rsquo; Ah, I am reading! I am reading!&rsquo; she exclaimed, with despair in
      her voice, and after a moment&rsquo;s silence she went on sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Books do not contain what the heart needs most, and there&rsquo;s much I cannot
      understand in them. And then, I feel weary to be reading all the time
      alone, alone! I want to speak to a man, but there is none to speak to! I
      feel disgusted. We live but once, and it is high time for me to live, and
      yet there is not a soul! Wherefore shall I live? Lipa tells me: &lsquo;Read and
      you will understand it.&rsquo; I want bread and she gives me a stone. I
      understand what one must do&mdash;one must stand up for what he loves and
      believes. He must fight for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she concluded, uttering something like a moan:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am alone! Whom shall I fight? There are no enemies here. There are
      no men! I live here in a prison!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma listened to her words, fixedly examining the fingers of his hand; he
      felt that in her words was some great distress, but he could not
      understand her. And when she became silent, depressed and sad, he found
      nothing to tell her save a few words that were like a reproach:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you yourself say that books are worthless to you, and yet you
      instruct me to read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked into his face, and anger flashed in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how I wish that all these torments would awaken within you, the
      torments that constantly oppress me. That your thoughts, like mine, would
      rob you of your sleep, that you, too, would be disgusted with everything,
      and with yourself as well! I despise every one of you. I hate you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All aflush, she looked at him so angrily and spoke with so much
      spitefulness, that in his astonishment he did not even feel offended by
      her. She had never before spoken to him in such manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; he asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate you, too! You, what are you? Dead, empty; how will you live? What
      will you give to mankind?&rdquo; she said with malice, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give nothing; let them strive for it themselves,&rdquo; answered Foma,
      knowing that these words would augment her anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunate creature!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assurance and the power of her reproaches involuntarily compelled Foma
      to listen attentively to her spiteful words; he felt there was common
      sense in them. He even came nearer to her, but she, enraged and
      exasperated, turned away from him and became silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still light outside, and the reflection of the setting sun lay
      still on the branches of the linden-trees before the windows, but the room
      was already filled with twilight, and the sideboard, the clock and the
      cupboard seemed to have grown in size. The huge pendulum peeped out every
      moment from beneath the glass of the clock-case, and flashing dimly, was
      hiding with a weary sound now on the right side, now on the left. Foma
      looked at the pendulum and he began to feel awkward and lonesome. Luba
      arose and lighted the lamp which was hanging over the table. The girl&rsquo;s
      face was pale and stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went for me,&rdquo; said Foma, reservedly. &ldquo;What for? I can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to speak to you!&rdquo; replied Luba, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your affair. But nevertheless, what wrong have I done to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand me, I am suffocating! It is close here. Is this life? Is this
      the way how to live? What am I? I am a hanger-on in my father&rsquo;s house.
      They keep me here as a housekeeper. Then they&rsquo;ll marry me! Again
      housekeeping. It&rsquo;s a swamp. I am drowning, suffocating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have I to do with it?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are no better than the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore I am guilty before you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, guilty! You must desire to be better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do I not wish it?&rdquo; exclaimed Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was about to tell him something, but at this time the bell began
      to ring somewhere, and she said in a low voice, leaning back in her chair:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not feel sorry if he stayed away a little longer,&rdquo; said Foma. &ldquo;I
      wish I could listen to you some more. You speak so very oddly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my children, my doves!&rdquo; exclaimed Yakov Tarasovich, appearing in the
      doorway. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re drinking tea? Pour out some tea for me, Lugava!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sweetly smiling, and rubbing his hands, he sat down near Foma and asked,
      playfully jostling him in the side:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been cooing about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&mdash;about different trifles,&rdquo; answered Luba.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t asked you, have I?&rdquo; said her father to her, with a grimace.
      &ldquo;You just sit there, hold your tongue, and mind your woman&rsquo;s affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been telling her about the dinner,&rdquo; Foma interrupted his godfather&rsquo;s
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! So-o-o. Well, then, I&rsquo;ll also speak about the dinner. I have been
      watching you of late. You don&rsquo;t behave yourself sensibly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Foma, knitting his brow, ill pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just mean that your behaviour is preposterous, and that&rsquo;s all. When the
      governor, for instance, speaks to you, you keep quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should I tell him? He says that it is a misfortune to lose a father.
      Well, I know it. What could I tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But as the Lord willed it so, I do not grumble, your Excellency. That&rsquo;s
      what you should have said, or something in this spirit. Governors, my
      dear, are very fond of meekness in a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I to look at him like a lamb?&rdquo; said Foma, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did look like a lamb, and that was unnecessary. You must look neither
      like a lamb, nor like a wolf, but just play off before him as though
      saying: &lsquo;You are our father, we are your children,&rsquo; and he will
      immediately soften.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is this for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For any event. A governor, my dear, can always be of use somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you teach him, papa?&rdquo; said Luba, indignantly, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To dance attendance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie, you learned fool! I teach him politics, not dancing attendance;
      I teach him the politics of life. You had better leave us alone! Depart
      from evil, and prepare some lunch for us. Go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Luba rose quickly and throwing the towel across the back of the chair,
      left the room. Mayakin, winking his eyes, looked after her, tapped the
      table with his fingers and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall instruct you, Foma. I shall teach you the most genuine, true
      knowledge and philosophy, and if you understand them, your life will be
      faultless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma saw how the wrinkles on the old man&rsquo;s forehead were twitching, and
      they seemed to him like lines of Slavonic letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First of all, Foma, since you live on this earth, it is your duty to
      think over everything that takes place about you. Why? That you may not
      suffer for your own senselessness, and may not harm others by your folly.
      Now, every act of man is double-faced, Foma. One is visible to all&mdash;this
      is the wrong side; the other is concealed&mdash;and that is the real one.
      It is that one that you must be able to find in order to understand the
      sense of the thing. Take for example the lodging-asylums, the work-houses,
      the poor-houses and other similar institutions. Just consider, what are
      they for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to consider here?&rdquo; said Foma, wearily &ldquo;Everybody knows what
      they are for&mdash;for the poor and feeble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, dear! Sometimes everybody knows that a certain man is a rascal and a
      scoundrel, and yet all call him Ivan or Peter, and instead of abusing him
      they respectfully add his father&rsquo;s name to his own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has this to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all to the point. So you say that these houses are for the poor, for
      beggars, consequently, in accordance with Christ&rsquo;s commandment. Very well!
      But who is the beggar? The beggar is a man, forced by fate to remind us of
      Christ; he is a brother of Christ; he is the bell of the Lord and he rings
      in life to rouse our conscience, to arouse the satiety of the flesh of
      man. He stands by the window and sings out: &lsquo;For the sake of Christ!&rsquo; and
      by his singing he reminds us of Christ, of His holy commandment to help
      the neighbour. But men have so arranged their life that it is impossible
      for them to act according to the teachings of Christ, and Jesus Christ has
      become altogether unnecessary to us. Not one time, but perhaps a hundred
      thousand times have we turned Him over to the cross, and yet we cannot
      drive Him altogether out of life, because His poor brethren sing His Holy
      name on the streets and thus remind us of Him. And now we have arranged to
      lock up these beggars in separate houses that they should not walk around
      on the streets and should not rouse our conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cle-ver!&rdquo; whispered Foma, amazed, staring fixedly at his godfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; exclaimed Mayakin, his eyes beaming with triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it that my father did not think of this?&rdquo; asked Foma, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just wait! Listen further, it is still worse. So you see, we have
      arranged to lock them up in all sorts of houses and that they might be
      kept there cheaply, we have compelled those old and feeble beggars to work
      and we need give no alms now, and since our streets have been cleared of
      the various ragged beggars, we do not see their terrible distress and
      poverty, and we may, therefore, think that all men on earth are well-fed,
      shod and clothed. That&rsquo;s what all these different houses are for, for the
      concealment of the truth, for the banishment of Christ from our life! Is
      this clear to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Foma, confused by the old man&rsquo;s clever words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this is not all. The pool is not yet baled out to the bottom!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Mayakin, swinging his hand in the air with animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wrinkles of his face were in motion; his long, ravenous nose was
      stirring, and in his voice rang notes of irritability and emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, let us look at this thing from the other side. Who contributes most
      in favour of the poor, for the support of these houses, asylums,
      poor-houses? The rich people, the merchants, our body of merchants. Very
      well! And who commands our life and regulates it? The nobles, the
      functionaries and all sorts of other people, not belonging to our class.
      From them come the laws, the newspapers, science&mdash;everything from
      them. Before, they were land-owners, now their land was snatched away from
      them&mdash;and they started out in service. Very well! But who are the
      most powerful people today? The merchant is the supreme power in an
      empire, because he has the millions on his side! Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True!&rdquo; assented Foma, eager to hear the sooner that which was to follow,
      and which was already sparkling in the eyes of his godfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just mark this,&rdquo; the old man went on distinctly and impressively. &ldquo;We
      merchants had no hand in the arrangement of life, nor do we have a voice
      or a hand in it today. Life was arranged by others, and it is they that
      multiplied all sorts of scabs in life&mdash;idlers and poor unfortunates;
      and since by multiplying them they obstructed life and spoilt it&mdash;it
      is, justly judging, now their duty to purify it. But we are purifying it,
      we contribute money for the poor, we look after them&mdash;we, judge it
      for yourself, why should we mend another&rsquo;s rags, since we did not tear
      them? Why should we repair a house, since others have lived in it and
      since it belongs to others? Were it not wiser for us to step aside and
      watch until a certain time how rottenness is multiplying and choking those
      that are strangers to us? They cannot conquer it, they have not the means
      to do it. Then they will turn to us and say: &lsquo;Pray, help us, gentlemen!&rsquo; 
      and we&rsquo;ll tell them: &lsquo;Let us have room for our work! Rank us among the
      builders of this same life!&rsquo; And as soon as they do this we, too, will
      have to clear life at one sweep of all sorts of filth and chaff. Then the
      Emperor will see with his clear eyes who are really his faithful servants,
      and how much wisdom they have saved up while their hands were idle. Do you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I do!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his godfather spoke of the functionaries, Foma reminded himself of
      the people that were present at the dinner; he recalled the brisk
      secretary, and a thought flashed through his mind that this stout little
      man has in all probability an income of no more than a thousand roubles a
      year, while he, Foma, has a million. But that man lives so easily and
      freely, while he, Foma, does not know how to live, is indeed abashed to
      live. This comparison and his godfather&rsquo;s speech roused in him a whirl of
      thoughts, but he had time to grasp and express only one of them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, do we work for the sake of money only? What&rsquo;s the use of money if
      it can give us no power?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Mayakin, winking his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, offended. &ldquo;How about my father? Have you spoken to
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spoke to him for twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My words did not reach him. The crown of your father&rsquo;s head was rather
      thick. His soul was open to all, while his mind was hidden away far within
      him. Yes, he made a blunder, and I am very sorry about the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sorry for the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have tried to earn even a tenth part of it, then speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; came Luba&rsquo;s voice from behind the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, step right in,&rdquo; said the father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you have lunch now?&rdquo; she asked, entering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked up to the sideboard and soon the dishes were rattling. Yakov
      Tarasovich looked at her, moved his lips, and suddenly striking Foma&rsquo;s
      knee with his hand, he said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way, my godson! Think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma responded with a smile and thought: &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s clever&mdash;cleverer
      than my father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But another voice within him immediately replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cleverer, but worse.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      FOMA&rsquo;S dual relation toward Mayakin grew stronger and stronger as time
      went on; listening to his words attentively and with eager curiosity, he
      felt that each meeting with his godfather was strengthening in him the
      feeling of hostility toward the old man. Sometimes Yakov Tarasovich roused
      in his godson a feeling akin to fear, sometimes even physical aversion.
      The latter usually came to Foma whenever the old man was pleased with
      something and laughed. From laughter the old man&rsquo;s wrinkles would tremble,
      thus changing the expression of his face every now and then; his dry, thin
      lips would stretch out and move nervously, displaying black broken teeth,
      and his red little beard was as though aflame. His laughter sounded like
      the squeaking of rusty hinges, and altogether the old man looked like a
      lizard at play. Unable to conceal his feelings, Foma often expressed them
      to Mayakin rather rudely, both in words and in gesture, but the old man,
      pretending not to notice it, kept a vigilant eye on him, directing his
      each and every step. Wholly absorbed by the steamship affairs of the young
      Gordyeeff, he even neglected his own little shop, and allowed Foma
      considerable leisure time. Thanks to Mayakin&rsquo;s important position in town
      and to his extensive acquaintance on the Volga, business was splendid, but
      Mayakin&rsquo;s zealous interest in his affairs strengthened Foma&rsquo;s suspicions
      that his godfather was firmly resolved to marry him to Luba, and this made
      the old man more repulsive to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He liked Luba, but at the same time she seemed suspicious and dangerous
      for him. She did not marry, and Mayakin never said a word about it; he
      gave no evening parties, invited none of the youths to his house and did
      not allow Luba to leave the house. And all her girl friends were married
      already. Foma admired her words and listened to her just as eagerly as to
      her father; but whenever she started to speak of Taras with love and
      anguish, it seemed to him that she was hiding another man under that name,
      perhaps that same Yozhov, who according to her words, had to leave the
      university for some reason or other, and go to Moscow. There was a great
      deal of simplemindedness and kindness in her, which pleased Foma, and
      ofttimes her words awakened in him a feeling of pity for her; it seemed to
      him that she was not alive, that she was dreaming though awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      His conduct at the funeral feast for his father became known to all the
      merchants and gave him a bad reputation. On the Exchange, he noticed,
      everybody looked at him sneeringly, malevolently, and spoke to him in some
      peculiar way. One day he heard behind him a low exclamation, full of
      contempt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gordyeeff! Milksop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt that this was said of him, but he did not turn around to see who
      it was that flung those words at him. The rich people, who had inspired
      him with timidity before, were now losing in his eyes the witchery of
      their wealth and wisdom. They had more than once snatched out of his hands
      this or that profitable contract; he clearly saw that they would do it
      again, and they all seemed to him alike&mdash;greedy for money, always
      ready to cheat one another. When he imparted to his godfather his
      observation, the old man said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How then? Business is just the same as war&mdash;a hazardous affair.
      There they fight for the purse, and in the purse is the soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; announced Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I like everything&mdash;there&rsquo;s too much fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to be fair in business matters is utterly impossible; you must be
      shrewd! In business, dear, on approaching a man you must hold honey in
      your left hand, and clutch a knife in your right. Everybody would like to
      buy five copecks&rsquo; worth for a half a copeck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this isn&rsquo;t too good,&rdquo; said Foma, thoughtfully. &ldquo;But it will be good
      later. When you have taken the upper hand, then it will be good. Life,
      dear Foma, is very simple: either bite everybody, or lie in the gutter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man smiled, and the broken teeth in his mouth roused in Foma the
      keen thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have bitten many, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s but one word&mdash;battle!&rdquo; repeated the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the real one?&rdquo; asked Foma, looking at Mayakin searchingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, what do you mean&mdash;the real?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nothing better than this? Does this contain everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where else should it be? Everybody lives for himself. Each of us wishes
      the best for himself. And what is the best? To go in front of others, to
      stand above them. So that everybody is trying to attain the first place in
      life&mdash;one by this means, another by that means. But everyone is
      positively anxious to be seen from afar, like a tower. And man was indeed
      appointed to go upward. Even the Book of Job says: &lsquo;Man is born unto
      trouble, as the sparks, to fly upward.&rsquo; Just see: even children at play
      always wish to surpass one another. And each and every game has its
      climax, which makes it interesting. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand this!&rdquo; said Foma, firmly and confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must also feel this. With understanding alone you cannot go far,
      and you must desire, and desire so that a big mountain should seem to you
      but a hillock, and the sea but a puddle. Eh! When I was of your age I had
      an easy life, while you are only taking aim. But then, good fruit does not
      ripen early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s monotonous speeches soon accomplished what they were
      intended to do. Foma listened to them and made clear to himself the aim of
      life. He must be better than others, he resolved, and the ambition,
      kindled by the old man, took deep root in his heart. It took root within
      his heart, but did not fill it up, for Foma&rsquo;s relations toward Medinskaya
      assumed that character, which they were bound to assume. He longed for
      her, he always yearned to see her; while in her presence he became timid,
      awkward and stupid; he knew it and suffered on this account. He frequently
      visited her, but it was hard to find her at home alone; perfumed dandies
      like flies over a piece of sugar&mdash;were always flitting about her.
      They spoke to her in French, sang and laughed, while he looked at them in
      silence, tortured by anger and jealousy. His legs crossed, he sat
      somewhere in a corner of her richly furnished drawing-room, where it was
      extremely difficult to walk without overturning or at least striking
      against something&mdash;Foma sat and watched them sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the soft rugs she was noiselessly passing hither and thither, casting
      to him kind glances and smiles, while her admirers were fawning upon her,
      and they all, like serpents, were cleverly gliding by the various little
      tables, chairs, screens, flower-stands&mdash;a storehouse full of
      beautiful and frail things, scattered about the room with a carelessness
      equally dangerous to them and to Foma. But when he walked there, the rugs
      did not drown his footsteps, and all these things caught at his coat,
      trembled and fell. Beside the piano stood a sailor made of bronze, whose
      hand was lifted, ready to throw the life-saving ring; on this ring were
      ropes of wire, and these always pulled Foma by the hair. All this provoked
      laughter among Sophya Pavlovna and her admirers, and Foma suffered
      greatly, changing from heat to cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he felt no less uncomfortable even when alone with her. Greeting him
      with a kindly smile, she would take a seat beside him in one of the cosy
      corners of her drawing-room and would usually start her conversation by
      complaining to him of everybody:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe how glad I am to see you!&rdquo; Bending like a cat, she
      would gaze into his eyes with her dark glance, in which something avidious
      would now flash up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love to speak to you,&rdquo; she said, musically drawling her words. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      grown tired of all the rest of them. They&rsquo;re all so boring, ordinary and
      worn-out, while you are fresh, sincere. You don&rsquo;t like those people
      either, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear them!&rdquo; replied Foma, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And me?&rdquo; she asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma turned his eyes away from her and said, with a sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many times have you asked me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it hard for you to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t hard, but what for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making sport of me,&rdquo; said Foma, sternly. And she opened her eyes
      wide and inquired in a tone of great astonishment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I make sport of you? What does it mean to make sport?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And her face looked so angelic that he could not help believing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you! I love you! It is impossible not to love you!&rdquo; said he hotly,
      and immediately added sadly, lowering his voice: &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t need it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have it!&rdquo; sighed Medinskaya, satisfied, drawing back from him.
      &ldquo;I am always extremely pleased to hear you say this, with so much
      youthfulness and originality. Would you like to kiss my hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without saying a word he seized her thin, white little hand and carefully
      bending down to it, he passionately kissed it for a long time. Smiling and
      graceful, not in the least moved by his passion, she freed her hand from
      his. Pensively, she looked at him with that strange glitter in her eyes,
      which always confused Foma; she examined him as something rare and
      extremely curious, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much strength and power and freshness of soul you possess! Do you
      know? You merchants are an altogether new race, an entire race with
      original traditions, with an enormous energy of body and soul. Take you,
      for instance&mdash;you are a precious stone, and you should be polished.
      Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whenever she told him: &ldquo;You,&rdquo; or &ldquo;according to your merchant fashion,&rdquo; it
      seemed to Foma that she was pushing him away from her with these words.
      This at once saddened and offended him. He was silent, looking at her
      small maidenly figure, which was always somehow particularly well dressed,
      always sweet-scented like a flower. Sometimes he was seized with a wild,
      coarse desire to embrace and kiss her. But her beauty and the fragility of
      her thin, supple body awakened in him a fear of breaking and disfiguring
      her, and her calm, caressing voice and the clear, but somewhat cautious
      look of her eyes chilled his passion; it seemed to him as though she were
      looking straight into his soul, divining all his thoughts. But these
      bursts of emotion were rare. Generally the youth regarded Medinskaya with
      adoration, admiring everything in her&mdash;her beauty, her words, her
      dresses. And beside this adoration there was in him a painfully keen
      consciousness of his remoteness from her, of her supremacy over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      These relations were established between them within a short time; after
      two or three meetings Medinskaya was in full possession of the youth and
      she slowly began to torture him. Evidently she liked to have a healthy,
      strong youth at her mercy; she liked to rouse and tame the animal in him
      merely with her voice and glance, and confident of the power of her
      superiority, she found pleasure in thus playing with him. On leaving her,
      he was usually half-sick from excitement, bearing her a grudge, angry with
      himself, filled with many painful and intoxicating sensations. And about
      two days later he would come to undergo the same torture again.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he asked her timidly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophya Pavlovna! Have you ever had any children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought not!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She cast at him the look of a very naive little girl, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you think so? And why do you want to know whether I had any
      children or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma blushed, and, bending his head, began to speak to her in a heavy
      voice, as though he was lifting every word from the ground and as though
      each word weighed a few puds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see&mdash;a woman who&mdash;has given birth to children&mdash;such a
      woman has altogether different eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? What kind are they then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shameless!&rdquo; Foma blurted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medinskaya broke into her silver laughter, and Foma, looking at her, also
      began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; said he, at length. &ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;ve said something wrong,
      improper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no! You cannot say anything improper. You are a pure, amiable
      boy. And so, my eyes are not shameless?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours are like an angel&rsquo;s!&rdquo; announced Foma with enthusiasm, looking at
      her with beaming eyes. And she glanced at him, as she had never done
      before; her look was that of a mother, a sad look of love mingled with
      fear for the beloved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, dear one. I am tired; I need a rest,&rdquo; she said to him, as she rose
      without looking at him. He went away submissively.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time after this incident her attitude toward him was stricter and
      more sincere, as though she pitied him, but later their relations assumed
      the old form of the cat-and-mouse play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma&rsquo;s relation toward Medinskaya could not escape his godfather&rsquo;s notice,
      and one day the old man asked him, with a malicious grimace:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foma! You had better feel your head more often so that you may not lose
      it by accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I speak of Sonka. You are going to see her too often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has that to do with you?&rdquo; said Foma, rather rudely. &ldquo;And why do you
      call her Sonka?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to me. I would lose nothing if you should be fleeced. And as
      to calling her Sonka&mdash;everybody knows that is her name. So does
      everybody know that she likes to rake up the fire with other people&rsquo;s
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is clever!&rdquo; announced Foma, firmly, frowning and hiding his hands in
      his pockets. &ldquo;She is intelligent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever, that&rsquo;s true! How cleverly she arranged that entertainment; there
      was an income of two thousand four hundred roubles, the expenses&mdash;one
      thousand nine hundred; the expenses really did not even amount to a
      thousand roubles, for everybody does everything for her for nothing.
      Intelligent! She will educate you, and especially will those idlers that
      run around her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not idlers, they are clever people!&rdquo; replied Foma, angrily,
      contradicting himself now. &ldquo;And I learn from them. What am I? I know
      nothing. What was I taught? While there they speak of everything&mdash;and
      each one has his word to say. Do not hinder me from being like a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pooh! How you&rsquo;ve learned to speak! With so much anger, like the hail
      striking against the roof! Very well, be like a man, but in order to be
      like a man it might be less dangerous for you to go to the tavern; the
      people there are after all better than Sophya&rsquo;s people. And you, young
      man, you should have learned to discriminate one person from another. Take
      Sophya, for instance: What does she represent? An insect for the adornment
      of nature and nothing more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Intensely agitated, Foma set his teeth together and walked away from
      Mayakin, thrusting his hands still deeper into his pockets. But the old
      man soon started again a conversation about Medinskaya.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were on their way back from the bay after an inspection of the
      steamers, and seated in a big and commodious sledge, they were
      enthusiastically discussing business matters in a friendly way. It was in
      March. The water under the sledge-runners was bubbling, the snow was
      already covered with a rather dirty fleece, and the sun shone warmly and
      merrily in the clear sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go to your lady as soon as we arrive?&rdquo; asked Mayakin,
      unexpectedly, interrupting their business talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Foma, shortly, and with displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm. Tell me, how often do you give her presents?&rdquo; asked Mayakin, plainly
      and somewhat intimately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What presents? What for?&rdquo; Foma wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You make her no presents? You don&rsquo;t say. Does she live with you then
      merely so, for love&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma boiled up with anger and shame, turned abruptly toward the old man
      and said reproachfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! You are an old man, and yet you speak so that it is a shame to listen
      to you! To say such a thing! Do you think she would come down to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin smacked his lips and sang out in a mournful voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a blockhead you are! What a fool!&rdquo; and suddenly grown angry, he spat
      out: &ldquo;Shame upon you! All sorts of brutes drank out of the pot, nothing
      but the dregs remained, and now a fool has made a god unto himself of this
      dirty pot. Devil! You just go up to her and tell her plainly: &lsquo;I want to
      be your lover. I am a young man, don&rsquo;t charge me much for it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfather!&rdquo; said Foma, sternly, in a threatening voice, &ldquo;I cannot bear to
      hear such words. If it were someone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who except myself would caution you? Good God!&rdquo; Mayakin cried out,
      clasping his hands. &ldquo;So she has led you by the nose all winter long! What
      a nose! What a beast she is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man was agitated; in his voice rang vexation, anger, even tears
      Foma had never before seen him in such a state, and looking at him, he was
      involuntarily silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will ruin you! Oh Lord! The Babylonian prostitute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin&rsquo;s eyes were blinking, his lips were trembling, and in rude,
      cynical words he began to speak of Medinskaya, irritated, with a wrathful
      jar in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma felt that the old man spoke the truth. He now began to breathe with
      difficulty and he felt that his mouth had a dry, bitter taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, father, enough,&rdquo; he begged softly and sadly, turning aside
      from Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you ought to get married as soon as possible!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man
      with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Christ&rsquo;s sake, do not speak,&rdquo; uttered Foma in a dull voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin glanced at his godson and became silent. Foma&rsquo;s face looked drawn;
      he grew pale, and there was a great deal of painful, bitter stupor in his
      half-open lips and in his sad look. On the right and on the left of the
      road a field stretched itself, covered here and there with patches of
      winter-raiment. Rooks were hopping busily about over the black spots,
      where the snow had melted. The water under the sledge-runners was
      splashing, the muddy snow was kicked up by the hoofs of the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How foolish man is in his youth!&rdquo; exclaimed Mayakin, in a low voice. Foma
      did not look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before him stands the stump of a tree, and yet he sees the snout of a
      beast&mdash;that&rsquo;s how he frightens himself. Oh, oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak more plainly,&rdquo; said Foma, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to say? The thing is clear: girls are cream; women are
      milk; women are near, girls are far. Consequently, go to Sonka, if you
      cannot do without it, and tell her plainly. That&rsquo;s how the matter stands.
      Fool! If she is a sinner, you can get her more easily. Why are you so
      angry, then? Why so bristled up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Foma, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it I do not understand? I understand everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heart. Man has a heart,&rdquo; sighed the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin winked his eyes and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he has no mind.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <p>
      WHEN Foma arrived in the city he was seized with sad, revengeful anger. He
      was burning with a passionate desire to insult Medinskaya, to abuse her.
      His teeth firmly set together, his hands thrust deep into his pockets, he
      walked for a few hours in succession about the deserted rooms of his
      house, he sternly knitted his brow, and constantly threw his chest
      forward. His breast was too narrow to hold his heart, which was filled
      with wrath. He stamped the floor with heavy and measured steps, as though
      he were forging his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vile wretch&mdash;disguised herself as an angel!&rdquo; Pelageya vividly
      arose in his memory, and he whispered malignantly and bitterly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though a fallen woman, she is better. She did not play the hypocrite. She
      at once unfolded her soul and her body, and her heart is surely just as
      her breast&mdash;white and sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Hope would whisper timidly in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps all that was said of her was a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he recalled the eager certainty of his godfather, and the power of his
      words, and this thought perished. He set his teeth more firmly together
      and threw his chest still more forward. Evil thoughts like splinters of
      wood stuck into his heart, and his heart was shattered by the acute pain
      they caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      By disparaging Medinskaya, Mayakin made her more accessible to his godson,
      and Foma soon understood this. A few days passed, and Foma&rsquo;s agitated
      feelings became calm, absorbed by the spring business cares. The sorrow
      for the loss of the individual deadened the spite he owed the woman, and
      the thought of the woman&rsquo;s accessibility increased his passion for her.
      And somehow, without perceiving it himself, he suddenly understood and
      resolved that he ought to go up to Sophya Pavlovna and tell her plainly,
      openly, just what he wanted of her&mdash;that&rsquo;s all! He even felt a
      certain joy at this resolution, and he boldly started off to Medinskaya,
      thinking on the way only how to tell her best all that was necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants of Medinskaya were accustomed to his visits, and to his
      question whether the lady was at home the maid replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please go into the drawing-room. She is there alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He became somewhat frightened, but noticing in the mirror his stately
      figure neatly clad with a frock-coat, and his swarthy, serious face in a
      frame of a downy black beard, set with large dark eyes&mdash;he raised his
      shoulders and confidently stepped forward through the parlour. Strange
      sounds of a string instrument were calmly floating to meet him; they
      seemed to burst into quiet, cheerless laughter, complaining of something,
      tenderly stirring the heart, as though imploring it for attention and
      having no hopes of getting it. Foma did not like to hear music&mdash;it
      always filled him with sadness. Even when the &ldquo;machine&rdquo; in the tavern
      played some sad tune, his heart filled with melancholy anguish, and he
      would either ask them to stop the &ldquo;machine&rdquo; or would go away some little
      distance feeling that he could not listen calmly to these tunes without
      words, but full of lamentation and tears. And now he involuntarily stopped
      short at the door of the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curtain of long strings of parti-coloured glass beads hung over the
      door. The beads had been strung so as to form a fantastic figure of some
      kind of plants; the strings were quietly shaking and it seemed that pale
      shadows of flowers were soaring in the air. This transparent curtain did
      not hide the inside of the drawing-room from Foma&rsquo;s eyes. Seated on a
      couch in her favourite corner, Medinskaya played the mandolin. A large
      Japanese umbrella, fastened up to the wall, shaded the little woman in
      black by its mixture of colours; the high bronze lamp under a red
      lamp-shade cast on her the light of sunset. The mild sounds of the slender
      strings were trembling sadly in the narrow room, which was filled with
      soft and fragrant twilight. Now the woman lowered the mandolin on her
      knees and began running her fingers over the strings, also to examine
      fixedly something before her. Foma heaved a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soft sound of music soared about Medinskaya, and her face was forever
      changing as though shadows were falling on it, falling and melting away
      under the flash of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma looked at her and saw that when alone she was not quite so
      good-looking as in the presence of people&mdash;now her face looked older,
      more serious&mdash;her eyes had not the expression of kindness and
      gentleness, they had a rather tired and weary look. And her pose, too, was
      weary, as if the woman were about to stir but could not. Foma noticed that
      the feeling which prompted him to come to her was now changing in his
      heart into some other feeling. He scraped with his foot along the floor
      and coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; asked the woman, starting with alarm. And the strings
      trembled, issuing an alarmed sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; said Foma, pushing aside the strings of the beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! But how quietly you&rsquo;ve entered. I am glad to see you. Be seated! Why
      didn&rsquo;t you come for such a long time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Holding out her hand to him, she pointed with the other at a small
      armchair beside her, and her eyes were gaily smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was out on the bay inspecting my steamers,&rdquo; said Foma, with exaggerated
      ease, moving his armchair nearer to the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there much snow yet on the fields?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much as one may want. But it is already melting considerably. There is
      water on the roads everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her and smiled. Evidently Medinskaya noticed the ease of his
      behaviour and something new in his smile, for she adjusted her dress and
      drew farther away from him. Their eyes met&mdash;and Medinskaya lowered
      her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Melting!&rdquo; said she, thoughtfully, examining the ring on her little
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es, streams everywhere.&rdquo; Foma informed her, admiring his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Spring is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it won&rsquo;t be delayed long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spring is coming,&rdquo; repeated Medinskaya, softly, as if listening to the
      sounds of her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People will start to fall in love,&rdquo; said Foma, with a smile, and for some
      reason or other firmly rubbed his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you preparing yourself?&rdquo; asked Medinskaya, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no need for it. I have been ready long ago. I am already in love
      for all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She cast a glance at him, and started to play again, looking at the
      strings and saying pensively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spring. How good it is that you are but beginning to live. The heart is
      full of power, and there is nothing dark in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophya Pavlovna!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, softly. She interrupted him with a
      caressing gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, dearest! Today I can tell you something good. Do you know, a person
      who has lived long has such moments that when he looks into his heart he
      unexpectedly finds there something long forgotten. For years it lay
      somewhere in the depth of his heart, but lost none of the fragrance of
      youth, and when memory touches it, then spring comes over that person,
      breathing upon him the vivifying freshness of the morning of his life.
      This is good, though it is very sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The strings trembled and wept under the touch of her fingers, and it
      seemed to Foma that their sounds and the soft voice of the woman were
      touching his heart gently and caressingly. But, still firm in his
      decision, he listened to her words and, not knowing their meaning,
      thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may speak! And I won&rsquo;t believe anything you may say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This thought irritated him. And he felt sorry that he could not listen to
      her words as attentively and trustfully as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you thinking of how it is necessary to live?&rdquo; asked the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I think of it, and then I forget again. I have no time for it!&rdquo;
       said Foma and smiled. &ldquo;And then, what is there to think of? It is simple.
      You see how others live. Well, consequently, you must imitate them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t do this! Spare yourself. You are so good! There is something
      peculiar in you; what&mdash;I do not know. But it can be felt. And it
      seems to me, it will be very hard for you to get along in life. I am sure,
      you will not go along the usual way of the people of your circle. No! You
      cannot be pleased with a life which is wholly devoted to gain, to hunts
      after the rouble, to this business of yours. Oh, no! I know, you will have
      a desire for something else, will you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke quickly, with a look of alarm in her eyes. Looking at her, Foma
      thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is she driving at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he answered her slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I will have a desire for something else. Perhaps I have it
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drawing up closer to him, she looked into his face and spoke convincingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! Do not live like all other people! Arrange your life somehow
      differently. You are strong, young. You are good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I am good then there must be good for me!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, feeling
      that he was seized with agitation, and that his heart was beginning to
      beat with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but that is not the case! Here on earth it is worse for the good
      people than for the bad ones!&rdquo; said Medinskaya, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And again the trembling notes of music began to dance at the touch of her
      fingers. Foma felt that if he did not start to say at once what was
      necessary, he would tell her nothing later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; he said to himself, and in a lowered voice, strengthening
      his heart, began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophya Pavlovna! Enough! I have something to say. I have come to tell
      you: &lsquo;Enough!&rsquo; We must deal fairly, openly. At first you have attracted me
      to yourself, and now you are fencing away from me. I cannot understand
      what you say. My mind is dull, but I can feel that you wish to hide
      yourself. I can see it&mdash;do you understand now what brought me here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes began to flash and with each word his voice became warmer and
      louder. She moved her body forward and said with alarm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, cease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t, I will speak!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what you want to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know it all!&rdquo; said Foma, threateningly, rising to his feet.
      &ldquo;But I know everything about you&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? Then the better it is for me,&rdquo; said Medinskaya, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She also arose from the couch, as though about to go away somewhere, but
      after a few seconds she again seated herself on the couch. Her face was
      serious, her lips were tightly compressed, but her eyes were lowered, and
      Foma could not see their expression. He thought that when he told her, &ldquo;I
      know everything about you!&rdquo; she would be frightened, she would feel
      ashamed and confused, would ask his forgiveness for having made sport of
      him. Then he would embrace her and forgive her. But that was not the case;
      it was he who was confused by her calmness. He looked at her, searching
      for words to resume his speech, but found them not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better,&rdquo; she repeated firmly and drily. &ldquo;So you have learned
      everything, have you? And, of course, you&rsquo;ve censured me, as I deserve. I
      understand. I am guilty before you. But no, I cannot justify myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She became silent and suddenly, lifting her hands with a nervous gesture,
      clasped her head, and began to adjust her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma heaved a deep sigh. Her words had killed in him a certain hope&mdash;a
      hope, whose presence in his heart he only felt now that it was dead. And
      shaking his head, he said, with bitter reproach:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a time when I looked at you and thought, &lsquo;How beautiful she is,
      how good, the dove!&rsquo; And now you say yourself, &lsquo;I am guilty.&rsquo; Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the youth broke down. And the woman began to laugh softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fine and how ridiculous you are, and what a pity that you cannot
      understand all this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The youth looked at her, feeling himself disarmed by her caressing words
      and melancholy smile. That cold, harsh something, which he had in his
      heart against her, was now melting before the warm light of her eyes. The
      woman now seemed to him small, defenseless, like a child. She was saying
      something in a gentle voice as though imploring, and forever smiling, but
      he paid no attention to her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to you,&rdquo; said he, interrupting her words, &ldquo;without pity. I
      meant to tell you everything. And yet I said nothing. I don&rsquo;t feel like
      doing it. My heart sank. You are breathing upon me so strangely. Eh, I
      should not have seen you! What are you to me? It would be better for me to
      go away, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, dearest, don&rsquo;t go away!&rdquo; said the woman, hastily, holding out her
      hand to him. &ldquo;Why so severe? Do not be angry at me! What am I to you? You
      need a different friend, a woman just as simple-minded and sound-souled as
      you are. She must be gay, healthy. I&mdash;I am already an old woman. I am
      forever worrying. My life is so empty and so weary, so empty! Do you know,
      when a person has grown accustomed to live merrily, and then cannot be
      merry, he feels bad! He desires to live cheerfully, he desires to laugh,
      yet he does not laugh&mdash;it is life that is laughing at him. And as to
      men. Listen! Like a mother, I advise you, I beg and implore you&mdash;obey
      no one except your own heart! Live in accordance with its promptings. Men
      know nothing, they cannot tell you anything that is true. Do not heed
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trying to speak as plainly and intelligibly as possible, she was agitated,
      and her words came incoherently hurriedly one after another. A pitiful
      smile played on her lips all the time, and her face was not beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is very strict. It wants all people to submit to its requests, and
      only the very strong ones can resist it with impunity. It is yet
      questionable whether they can do it! Oh, if you knew how hard it is to
      live. Man goes so far that he begins to fear his own self. He is split
      into judge and criminal&mdash;he judges his own self and seeks
      justification before himself. And he is willing to pass days and nights
      with those that despise him, and that are repulsive to him&mdash;just to
      avoid being alone with himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma lifted his head and said distrustfully, with surprise:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot understand what it is! Lubov also says the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which Lubov? What does she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My foster-sister. She says the same,&mdash;she is forever complaining of
      life. It is impossible to live, she says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she is yet young! And it is a great happiness that she already speaks
      of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happiness!&rdquo; Foma drawled out mockingly. &ldquo;It must be a fine happiness that
      makes people sigh and complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better listen to complaints. There is always much wisdom in these
      complaints of men. Oh! There is more wisdom in these complaints than
      anywhere else. You listen to these,&mdash;they will teach you to find your
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma heard the woman&rsquo;s voice, which sounded convincing; and perplexed,
      looked about him. Everything had long been familiar to him, but today it
      looked somewhat new to him. A mass of trifles filled the room, all the
      walls were covered with pictures and shelves, bright and beautiful objects
      were staring from every corner. The reddish light of the lamp filled one
      with melancholy. Twilight wrapped everything in the room, and only here
      and there the gold of the frames, or the white spots of marble flashed
      dimly. Heavy fabrics were motionlessly hanging before the doors. All this
      embarrassed and almost choked Foma; he felt as though he had lost his way.
      He was sorry for the woman. But she also irritated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear how I speak to you? I wish I were your mother, or your
      sister. Never before did anybody awaken in me so warm and kindred a
      feeling as you have done. And you, you look at me in such an unfriendly
      way. Do you believe me? Yes? No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her and said with a sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I used to believe you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now?&rdquo; she asked hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&mdash;it is best for me to go! I don&rsquo;t understand anything, and
      yet I long to understand. I do not even understand myself. On my way to
      you I knew what to say, and here all is confused. You have put me up on
      the rack, you have set me on edge. And then you tell me&mdash;&lsquo;I am as a
      mother to you&rsquo;&mdash;which means&mdash;begone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand me, I feel sorry for you!&rdquo; the woman exclaimed softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma&rsquo;s irritation against her was growing stronger and stronger, and as he
      went on speaking to her, his words became absurd. While he spoke, he kept
      on moving his shoulders as though tearing something that entangled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry? What for? I do not need it. Eh, I cannot speak well! It is bad to
      be dumb. But&mdash;I would have told you! You did not treat me properly&mdash;indeed,
      why have you so enticed a man? Am I a plaything for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wanted to see you by my side,&rdquo; said the woman simply, in a guilty
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not hear these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when it came to the point, you were frightened and you shut yourself
      off from me. You began to repent. Ha, ha! Life is bad! And why are you
      always complaining of some life? What life? Man is life, and except man
      there is no life. You have invented some other monster. You have done this
      to deceive the eye, to justify yourself. You do some mischief, you lose
      yourself in different inventions and foolishnesses and then you sigh! Ah,
      life! Oh, life! And have you not done it yourself? And covering yourself
      with complaints, you confuse others. You have lost your way, very well,
      but why do you want to lead me astray? Is it wickedness that speaks in
      you: &lsquo;I feel bad,&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;let him also feel bad&mdash;there, I&rsquo;ll
      besprinkle his heart with my poisonous tears!&rsquo; Isn&rsquo;t that so? Eh! God has
      given you the beauty of an angel, but your heart&mdash;where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Standing before her, he trembled in every limb, and examined her from head
      to foot with reproachful looks. Now his words came freely from his heart,
      he spoke not loud, but with power and pleasure. Her head raised, the woman
      stared into his face, with wide-open eyes. Her lips were trembling and
      deep wrinkles appeared at the corners of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful person should lead a good life. While of you they say
      things.&rdquo; Foma&rsquo;s voice broke down; he raised his hand and concluded in a
      dull voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye!&rdquo; said Medinskaya, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not give her his hand, but, turning abruptly, he walked away from
      her. But already at the door he felt that he was sorry for her, and he
      glanced at her across his shoulder. There, in the corner, she stood alone,
      her head bent, her hands hanging motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding that he could not leave her thus, he became confused, and
      said softly, but without repenting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I said something offensive&mdash;forgive me! For after all I love
      you,&rdquo; and he heaved a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman burst into soft, nervous laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you have not offended me. God speed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then goodbye!&rdquo; repeated Foma in a still lower voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the woman, also in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma pushed aside the strings of beads with his hand; they swung back
      noisily and touched his cheeks. He shuddered at this cold touch and went
      out, carrying away a heavy, perplexed feeling in his breast, with his
      heart beating as though a soft but strong net were cast over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was night by this time; the moon was shining and the frost covered the
      puddles with coatings of dull silver. Foma walked along the sidewalk, he
      broke these with his cane, and they cracked mournfully. The shadows of the
      houses fell on the road in black squares, and the shadows of the trees&mdash;in
      wonderful patterns. And some of them looked like thin hands, helplessly
      clutching the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is she doing now?&rdquo; thought Foma, picturing to himself the woman,
      alone, in the corner of a narrow room, in the reddish half-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is best for me to forget her,&rdquo; he decided. But he could not forget
      her; she stood before him, provoking in him now intense pity, now
      irritation and even anger. And her image was so clear, and the thoughts of
      her were so painful, as though he was carrying this woman in his breast. A
      cab was coming from the opposite side, filling the silence of the night
      with the jarring of the wheels on the cobble-stones and with their
      creaking on the ice. When the cab was passing across a moonlit strip, the
      noise was louder and more brisk, and in the shadows it was heavier and
      duller. The driver and the passenger in it were shaking and hopping about;
      for some reason or other they both bent forward and together with the
      horse formed one big, black mass. The street was speckled with spots of
      light and shade, but in the distance the darkness seemed thick as though
      the street were fenced off by a wall, rising from earth to the skies.
      Somehow it occurred to Foma that these people did not know whither they
      were going. And he, too, did not know whither he was going. His house rose
      before his imagination&mdash;six big rooms, where he lived alone. Aunt
      Anfisa had gone to the cloister, perhaps never to return&mdash;she might
      die there. At home were Ivan, the old deaf dvornik, the old maid,
      Sekleteya, his cook and servant, and a black, shaggy dog, with a snout as
      blunt as that of a sheat-fish. And the dog, too, was old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I really ought to get married,&rdquo; thought Foma, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the very thought of how easy it was for him to get married made him
      ill at ease, and even ridiculous in his own eyes. It were but necessary to
      ask his godfather tomorrow for a bride,&mdash;and before a month would
      pass, a woman would live with him in his house. And she would be near him
      day and night. He would say to her: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go for a walk!&rdquo; and she would
      go. He would tell her: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to sleep!&rdquo; and again she would go. Should
      she desire to kiss him, she would kiss him, even though he did not like
      it. And if he should tell her: &ldquo;Go away, I don&rsquo;t want it,&rdquo; she would feel
      offended. What would he speak to her about? What would she tell him? He
      thought and pictured to himself young ladies of his acquaintance,
      daughters of merchants. Some of them were very pretty, and he knew that
      any one of them would marry him willingly. But he did not care to have any
      of them as his wife. How awkward and shameful it must be when a girl
      becomes a wife. And what does the newly-married couple say to each other
      after the wedding, in the bedroom? Foma tried to think what he would say
      in such a case, and confused, he began to laugh, finding no appropriate
      words. Then he recalled Luba Mayakin. She would surely be first to say
      something, uttering some unintelligible words, which were foreign to
      herself. Somehow it seemed to him that all her words were foreign, and she
      did not speak as was proper for a girl of her age, appearance and descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here his thoughts rested on Lubov&rsquo;s complaints. His gait became
      slower; he was now astounded by the fact that all the people that were
      near to him and with whom he talked a great deal, always spoke to him of
      life. His father, his aunt, his godfather, Lubov, Sophya Pavlovna, all
      these either taught him to understand life, or complained of it. He
      recalled the words said by the old man on the steamer about Fate, and many
      other remarks on life, reproaches and bitter complaints against it, which
      he happened to hear from all sorts of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;what is life, if it is not man? And man
      always speaks as if life were something else, something outside of man,
      and that something hinders him from living. Perhaps it is the devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A painful feeling of fear fell on the youth; he shuddered and hastily
      looked around. The street was deserted and quiet; the dark windows of the
      houses stared dimly into the dark of night, and along the walls and fences
      Foma&rsquo;s shadow followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Driver!&rdquo; he cried out aloud, quickening his steps. The shadow started and
      crawled after him, frightened, black, silent. It seemed to Foma that there
      was a cold breath behind him, and that something huge, invisible, and
      terrible was overtaking him. Frightened, he almost ran to meet the cab,
      which appeared noisily from the darkness, and when he seated himself in
      the cab, he dared not look back, though he wished to do so.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <p>
      ABOUT a week passed since Foma spoke to Medinskaya. And her image stood
      fixedly before Foma by night and by day, awakening in his heart a gnawing
      feeling of anxiety. He longed to go to her, and was so much afflicted over
      her that even his bones were aching from the desire of his heart to be
      near her again. But he was sternly silent; he frowned and did not care to
      yield to this desire, industriously occupying himself with his affairs and
      provoking in himself a feeling of anger against the woman. He felt that if
      he went up to her, he would no longer find her to be the same as he had
      left her; something must have changed within her after that conversation,
      and she would no longer receive him as cordially as before, would not
      smile at him the clear smile that used to awaken in him strange thoughts
      and hopes. Fearing that all this was lost and that something else must
      have taken its place, he restrained himself and suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      His work and his longing for the woman did not hinder him from thinking of
      life. He did not philosophize about this enigma, which was already
      stirring a feeling of alarm in his heart; he was not able to argue, but he
      began to listen attentively to everything that men said of life, and he
      tried to remember their words. They did not make anything clear to him;
      nay, they increased his perplexity and prompted him to regard them
      suspiciously. They were clever, cunning and sensible&mdash;he saw it; in
      dealings with them it was always necessary to be on one&rsquo;s guard; he knew
      already that in important matters none of them spoke as they thought. And
      watching them carefully, he felt that their sighs and their complaints of
      life awakened in him distrust. Silently he looked at everybody with
      suspicion, and a thin wrinkle masked his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning his godfather said to him on the Exchange:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anany has arrived. He would like to see you. Go up to him toward evening,
      and see that you hold your tongue. Anany will try to loosen it in order to
      make you talk on business matters. He is cunning, the old devil; he is a
      holy fox; he&rsquo;ll lift his eyes toward heaven, and meanwhile will put his
      paw into your pocket and grab your purse. Be on your guard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do we owe him anything?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! We haven&rsquo;t paid yet for the barge, and then fifty five-fathom
      beams were taken from him not long ago. If he wants everything at once&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      give. A rouble is a sticky thing; the longer it turns about in your hand,
      the more copecks will stick to it. A rouble is like a good pigeon&mdash;it
      goes up in the air, you turn around and see&mdash;it has brought a whole
      flock with it into the pigeon-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can we help paying it now, if he demands it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him cry and ask for it&mdash;and you roar&mdash;but don&rsquo;t give it to
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up there soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anany Savvich Shchurov was a rich lumber-dealer, had a big saw-mill, built
      barges and ran rafts. He had had dealings with Ignat, and Foma had more
      than once seen this tall, heavily-bearded, long-armed, white-haired old
      man, who kept himself as erect as a pine-tree. His big, handsome figure,
      his open face and his clear eyes called forth in Foma a feeling of respect
      for Shchurov, although he heard it rumoured that this lumber-dealer had
      gained his wealth not by honest toil and that he was leading an evil life
      at home, in an obscure village of the forest district; and Ignat had told
      Foma that when Shchurov was young and was but a poor peasant, he sheltered
      a convict in the bath-house, in his garden, and that there the convict
      made counterfeit money for him. Since that time Anany began to grow rich.
      One day his bathhouse burned down, and in the ashes they discovered the
      corpse of a man with a fractured skull. There was a rumour in the village
      that Shchurov himself had killed his workman&mdash;killed and then burned
      him. Such things had happened more than once with the good-looking old
      man; but similar rumours were on foot with reference to many a rich man in
      town&mdash;they had all, it was said, hoarded up their millions by way of
      robberies, murders and, mainly, by passing counterfeit money. Foma had
      heard such stories in his childhood and he never before considered whether
      they were true or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also knew that Shchurov had got rid of two wives&mdash;one of them died
      during the first night of the wedding, in Anany&rsquo;s embraces. Then he took
      his son&rsquo;s wife away from him, and his son took to drink for grief and
      would have perished in drunkenness had he not come to himself in time and
      gone off to save himself in a hermitage, in Irgiz. And when his
      mistress-daughter-in-law had passed away, Shchurov took into his house a
      dumb beggar-girl, who was living with him to this day, and who had
      recently borne him a dead child. On his way to the hotel, where Anany
      stayed, Foma involuntarily recalled all this, and felt that Shchurov had
      become strangely interesting to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Foma opened the door and stopped respectfully on the threshold of the
      small room, whose only window overlooked the rusty roof of the
      neighbouring house, he noticed that the old Shchurov had just risen from
      sleep, and sitting on his bed, leaning his hands against it, he stared at
      the ground; and he was so bent that his long, white beard fell over his
      knees. But even bent, he was large.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who entered?&rdquo; asked Anany in a hoarse and angry voice, without lifting
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I. How do you do, Anany Savvich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man raised his head slowly and, winking his large eyes, looked at
      Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ignat&rsquo;s son, is that right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come over here, sit down by the window. Let me see how you&rsquo;ve grown
      up. Will you not have a glass of tea with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiter!&rdquo; cried the old man, expanding his chest, and, taking his beard in
      his hand, he began to examine Foma in silence. Foma also looked at him
      stealthily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s lofty forehead was all covered with wrinkles, and its skin
      was dark. Gray, curly locks covered his temples and his sharp-pointed
      ears; his calm blue eyes lent the upper part of his face a wise and good
      expression. But his cheeks and his lips were thick and red, and seemed out
      of place on his face. His thin, long nose was turned downward as though it
      wished to hide itself in his white moustache; the old man moved his lips,
      and from beneath them small, yellow teeth were gleaming. He had on a pink
      calico shirt, a silk belt around his waist, and black, loose trousers,
      which were tucked into his boots. Foma stared at his lips and thought that
      the old man was surely such as he was said to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a boy you looked more like your father,&rdquo; said Shchurov suddenly, and
      sighed. Then, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, he asked: &ldquo;Do you remember your
      father? Do you ever pray for him? You must, you must pray!&rdquo; he went on,
      after he heard Foma&rsquo;s brief answer. &ldquo;Ignat was a terrible sinner, and he
      died without repentance, taken unawares. He was a great sinner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was not more sinful than others,&rdquo; replied Foma, angrily, offended in
      his father&rsquo;s behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than who, for instance?&rdquo; demanded Shchurov, strictly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there not plenty of sinners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but one man on earth more sinful than was the late Ignat&mdash;and
      that is that cursed heathen, your godfather Yashka,&rdquo; ejaculated the old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of it?&rdquo; inquired Foma, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Of course, I am!&rdquo; said Shchurov, confidently, nodding his head, and
      his eyes became somewhat darker. &ldquo;I will also appear before the Lord, and
      that not sinless. I shall bring with me a heavy burden before His holy
      countenance. I have been pleasing the devil myself, only I trust to God
      for His mercy, while Yashka believes in nothing, neither in dreams, nor in
      the singing of birds. Yashka does not believe in God, this I know! And for
      his non-belief he will yet receive his punishment on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure of this, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am. And don&rsquo;t you think I also know that you consider it ludicrous
      to listen to me. What a sagacious fellow, indeed! But he who has committed
      many sins is always wise. Sin is a teacher. That&rsquo;s why Yashka Mayakin is
      extraordinarily clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Listening to the old man&rsquo;s hoarse and confident voice, Foma thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is scenting death, it seems.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The waiter, a small man, with a face which was pale and characterless,
      brought in the samovar and quickly hastened out of the room, with short
      steps. The old man was undoing some bundles on the window-sill and said,
      without looking at Foma:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are bold, and the look of your eyes is dark. Before, there used to be
      more light-eyed people, because then the souls used to be brighter.
      Before, everything was simpler&mdash;both the people and the sins, and now
      everything has become complicated. Eh, eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made tea, seated himself opposite Foma and went on again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father at your age was a water-pumper and stayed with the fleet near
      our village. At your age Ignat was as clear to me as glass. At a single
      glance you could tell what sort of a man he was. While you&mdash;here I am
      looking at you, but cannot see what you are. Who are you? You don&rsquo;t know
      it yourself, my lad, and that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;ll suffer. Everybody nowadays must
      suffer, because they do not know themselves. Life is a mass of wind-fallen
      trees, and you must know how to find your way through it. Where is it? All
      are going astray, and the devil is delighted. Are you married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There again, you are not married, and yet, I&rsquo;m quite sure, you are not
      pure any longer. Well, are you working hard in your business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes. Meanwhile I am with my godfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of work is it you have nowadays?&rdquo; said the old man, shaking his
      head, and his eyes were constantly twinkling, now turning dark, now
      brightening up again. &ldquo;You have no labour now! In former years the
      merchant travelled with horses on business. Even at night, in snowstorms,
      he used to go! Murderers used to wait for him on the road and kill him.
      And he died a martyr, washing his sins away with blood. Now they travel by
      rail; they are sending telegrams, or they&rsquo;ve even invented something that
      a man may speak in his office and you can hear him five miles away. There
      the devil surely has a hand in it! A man sits, without motion, and commits
      sins merely because he feels lonesome, because he has nothing to do: the
      machine does all his work. He has no work, and without toil man is ruined!
      He has provided himself with machines and thinks it is good! While the
      machine is the devil&rsquo;s trap for you. He thus catches you in it. While
      toiling, you find no time for sin, but having a machine&mdash;you have
      freedom. Freedom kills a man, even as the sunbeams kill the worm, the
      dweller of the depth of earth. Freedom kills man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And pronouncing his words distinctly and positively, the old Anany struck
      the table four times with his finger. His face beamed triumphantly, his
      chest rose high, and over it the silver hair of his beard shook
      noiselessly. Dread fell on Foma as he looked at him and listened to his
      words, for there was a ring of firm faith in them, and it was the power of
      this faith that confused Foma. He had already forgotten all he knew about
      the old man, all of which he had but a while ago believed to be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever gives freedom to his body, kills his soul!&rdquo; said Anany, looking
      at Foma so strangely as if he saw behind him somebody, who was grieved and
      frightened by his words; and whose fear and pain delighted him. &ldquo;All you
      people of today will perish through freedom. The devil has captured you&mdash;he
      has taken toil away from you, and slipped machines and telegrams into your
      hands. How freedom eats into the souls of men! Just tell me, why are the
      children worse than their fathers? Because of their freedom, yes. That&rsquo;s
      why they drink and lead depraved lives with women. They have less strength
      because they have less work, and they have not the spirit of cheerfulness
      because they have no worries. Cheerfulness comes in time of rest, while
      nowadays no one is getting tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Foma, softly, &ldquo;they were leading depraved lives and drinking
      just as much in former days as now, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know it? You should keep silence!&rdquo; cried Anany, flashing his eyes
      sternly. &ldquo;In former days man had more strength, and the sins were
      according to his strength. While you, of today, have less strength, and
      more sins, and your sins are more disgusting. Then men were like
      oak-trees. And God&rsquo;s judgment will also be in accordance with their
      strength. Their bodies will be weighed, and angels will measure their
      blood, and the angels of God will see that the weight of the sins does not
      exceed the weight of the body and the blood. Do you understand? God will
      not condemn the wolf for devouring a sheep, but if a miserable rat should
      be guilty of the sheep&rsquo;s death, God will condemn the rat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can a man tell how God will judge man?&rdquo; asked Foma, thoughtfully. &ldquo;A
      visible trial is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why a visible trial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That people might understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, but the Lord, is my judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma glanced at the old man and lowering his head, became silent. He again
      recalled the fugitive convict, who was killed and burnt by Shchurov, and
      again he believed that it really was so. And the women&mdash;his wives and
      his mistresses&mdash;had surely been hastened toward their graves by this
      old man&rsquo;s caresses; he had crushed them with his bony chest, drunk the sap
      of their life with these thick lips of his which were scarlet yet from the
      clotted blood of the women, who died in the embraces of his long sinewy
      arms. And now, awaiting death, which was already somewhere beside him, he
      counts his sins, judges others, and perhaps judges himself, and says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, but the Lord, is my judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he afraid or not?&rdquo; Foma asked himself and became pensive, stealthily
      scrutinising the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my lad! Think,&rdquo; spoke Shchurov, shaking his head, &ldquo;think, how you
      are to live. The capital in your heart is small, and your habits are
      great, see that you are not reduced to bankruptcy before your own self!
      Ho-ho-ho!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you tell what and how much I have within my heart?&rdquo; said Foma,
      gloomily, offended by his laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see it! I know everything, because I have lived long! Oh-ho-ho! How
      long I have lived! Trees have grown up and been cut down, and houses built
      out of them, and even the houses have grown old. While I have seen all
      this and am still alive, and when, at times, I recall my life, I think,
      &lsquo;Is it possible that one man could accomplish so much? Is it possible that
      I have witnessed all this?&rsquo;&rdquo; The old man glanced at Foma sternly, shook
      his head and became silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became quiet. Outside the window something was softly rustling on the
      roof of the house; the rattle of wheels and the muffled sounds of
      conversation were heard from below, from the street. The samovar on the
      table sang a sad tune. Shchurov was fixedly staring into his glass of tea,
      stroking his beard, and one could hear that something rattled in his
      breast, as if some burden was turning about in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for you to live without your father, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am getting used to it,&rdquo; replied Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are rich, and when Yakov dies, you will be richer still. He&rsquo;ll leave
      everything to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To whom else should he leave it? He has but one daughter, and you ought
      to marry that daughter, and that she is your godsister and foster-sister&mdash;no
      matter! That can be arranged&mdash;and then you would be married. What
      good is there in the life you are now leading? I suppose you are forever
      running about with the girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say! Eh, eh, eh! the merchant is passing away. A certain
      forester told me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know whether he lied or not&mdash;that in
      former days the dogs were wolves, and then degenerated into dogs. It is
      the same with our calling; we will soon also be dogs. We will take up
      science, put stylish hats on our heads, we&rsquo;ll do everything that is
      necessary in order to lose our features, and there will be nothing by
      which to distinguish us from other people. It has become a custom to make
      Gymnasium students of all children. The merchants, the nobles, the
      commoners&mdash;all are adjusted to match the same colour. They dress them
      in gray and teach them all the same subjects. They grow man even as they
      grow a tree. Why do they do it? No one knows. Even a log could be told
      from another by its knot at least, while here they want to plane the
      people over so that all of them should look alike. The coffin is already
      waiting for us old people. Ye-es! It may be that about fifty years hence,
      no one will believe that I lived in this world. I, Anany, the son of
      Savva, by the surname of Shchurov. So! And that I, Anany, feared no one,
      save God. And that in my youth I was a peasant, that all the land I
      possessed then was two desyatins and a quarter; while toward my old age I
      have hoarded up eleven thousand desyatins, all forests, and perhaps two
      millions in cash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, they always speak of money!&rdquo; said Foma, with dissatisfaction.
      &ldquo;What joy does man derive from money?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; bellowed Shchurov. &ldquo;You will
      make a poor merchant, if you do not understand the power of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who does understand it?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I!&rdquo; said Shchurov, with confidence. &ldquo;And every clever man. Yashka
      understands it. Money? That is a great deal, my lad! Just spread it out
      before you and think, &lsquo;What does it contain?&rsquo; Then will you know that all
      this is human strength, human mind. Thousands of people have put their
      life into your money and thousands more will do it. And you can throw it
      all into the fire and see how the money is burning, and at that moment you
      will consider yourself master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nobody does this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because fools have no money. Money is invested in business. Business
      gives bread to the masses. And you are master over all those masses.
      Wherefore did God create man? That man should pray to Him. He was alone
      and He felt lonesome, so He began to desire power, and as man was created
      in the image of the Lord, man also desires power. And what, save money,
      can give power? That&rsquo;s the way. Well, and you&mdash;have you brought me
      money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Foma. From the words of the old man Foma&rsquo;s head was heavy
      and troubled, and he was glad that the conversation had, at last, turned
      to business matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t right,&rdquo; said Shchurov, sternly knitting his brow. &ldquo;It is
      overdue&mdash;you must pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get a half of it tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why a half? Why not all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are badly in need of money now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And haven&rsquo;t you any? But I also need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, my lad, I will not wait! You are not your father. Youngsters like
      you, milksops, are an unreliable lot. In a month you may break up the
      whole business. And I would be the loser for it. You give me all the money
      tomorrow, or I&rsquo;ll protest the notes. It wouldn&rsquo;t take me long to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma looked at Shchurov, with astonishment. It was not at all that same
      old man, who but a moment ago spoke so sagaciously about the devil. Then
      his face and his eyes seemed different, and now he looked fierce, his lips
      smiled pitilessly, and the veins on his cheeks, near his nostrils, were
      eagerly trembling. Foma saw that if he did not pay him at once, Shchurov
      would indeed not spare him and would dishonour the firm by protesting the
      notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently business is poor?&rdquo; grinned Shchurov. &ldquo;Well, tell the truth&mdash;where
      have you squandered your father&rsquo;s money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma wanted to test the old man:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business is none too brisk,&rdquo; said he, with a frown. &ldquo;We have no
      contracts. We have received no earnest money, and so it is rather hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So-o! Shall I help you out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be so kind. Postpone the day of payment,&rdquo; begged Foma, modestly lowering
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm. Shall I assist you out of my friendship for your father? Well, be it
      so, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for how long will you postpone it?&rdquo; inquired Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For six months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you humbly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it. You owe me eleven thousand six hundred roubles. Now
      listen: rewrite the notes for the amount of fifteen thousand, pay me the
      interest on this sum in advance. And as security I&rsquo;ll take a mortgage on
      your two barges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma rose from the chair and said, with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send me the notes tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll pay you in full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shchurov also rose from his chair and, without lowering his eyes at Foma&rsquo;s
      sarcastic look, said, calmly scratching his chest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for your kindness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing! You don&rsquo;t give me a chance, or I would have shown you my
      kindness!&rdquo; said the old man lazily, showing his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! If one should fall into your hands&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;d find it warm&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure you&rsquo;d make it warm for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my lad, that will do!&rdquo; said Shchurov, sternly. &ldquo;Though you consider
      yourself quite clever, it is rather too soon. You&rsquo;ve gained nothing, and
      already you began to boast! But you just win from me&mdash;then you may
      shout for joy. Goodbye. Have all the money for tomorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that trouble you. Goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Foma came out of the room he heard that the old man gave a slow, loud
      yawn, and then began to hum in a rather hoarse bass:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open for us the doors of mercy. Oh blessed Virgin Mary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma carried away with him from the old man a double feeling. Shchurov
      pleased him and at the same time was repulsive to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recalled the old man&rsquo;s words about sin, thought of the power of his
      faith in the mercy of the Lord, and the old man aroused in Foma a feeling
      akin to respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He, too, speaks of life; he knows his sins; but does not weep over them,
      does not complain of them. He has sinned&mdash;and he is willing to stand
      the consequences. Yes. And she?&rdquo; He recalled Medinskaya, and his heart
      contracted with pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she is repenting. It is hard to tell whether she does it purposely,
      in order to hide from justice, or whether her heart is really aching.
      &lsquo;Who, but the Lord,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;is to judge me?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s how it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Foma that he envied Anany, and the youth hastened to recall
      Shchurov&rsquo;s attempts to swindle him. This called forth in him an aversion
      for the old man He could not reconcile his feelings and, perplexed, he
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have just been at Shchurov&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said, coming to Mayakin and
      seating himself by the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin, in a greasy morning-gown, a counting-board in his hand, began to
      move about in his leather-covered arm-chair impatiently, and said with
      animation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pour out some tea for him, Lubava! Tell me, Foma, I must be in the City
      Council at nine o&rsquo;clock; tell me all about it, make haste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smiling, Foma related to him how Shchurov suggested to rewrite the notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; exclaimed Yakov Tarasovich regretfully, with a shake of the head.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve spoilt the whole mass for me, dear! How could you be so
      straightforward in your dealings with the man? Psha! The devil drove me to
      send you there! I should have gone myself. I would have turned him around
      my finger!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly! He says, &lsquo;I am an oak.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An oak? And I am a saw. An oak! An oak is a good tree, but its fruits are
      good for swine only. So it comes out that an oak is simply a blockhead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all the same, we have to pay, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever people are in no hurry about this; while you are ready to run as
      fast as you can to pay the money. What a merchant you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yakov Tarasovich was positively dissatisfied with his godson. He frowned
      and in an angry manner ordered his daughter, who was silently pouring out
      tea:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Push the sugar nearer to me. Don&rsquo;t you see that I can&rsquo;t reach it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov&rsquo;s face was pale, her eyes seemed troubled, and her hands moved
      lazily and awkwardly. Foma looked at her and thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How meek she is in the presence of her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he speak to you about?&rdquo; asked Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course! His own affair is dearest to each and every man. And he
      is a manufacturer of sins. Both in the galleys and in hell they have long
      been weeping and longing for him, waiting for him impatiently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He speaks with weight,&rdquo; said Foma, thoughtfully, stirring his tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he abuse me?&rdquo; inquired Mayakin, with a malicious grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I listened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm! And what did you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The strong,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;will be forgiven; but there is no forgiveness for
      the weak.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think of it! What wisdom! Even the fleas know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some reason or another, the contempt with which Mayakin regarded
      Shchurov, irritated Foma, and, looking into the old man&rsquo;s face, he said
      with a grin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody likes me, my dear,&rdquo; said Mayakin, proudly. &ldquo;There is no reason why
      they should like me. I am no girl. But they respect me. And they respect
      only those they fear.&rdquo; And the old man winked at his godson boastfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He speaks with weight,&rdquo; repeated Foma. &ldquo;He is complaining. &lsquo;The real
      merchant,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;is passing away. All people are taught the same
      thing,&rsquo; he says: &lsquo;so that all may be equal, looking alike.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he consider it wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fo-o-o-l!&rdquo; Mayakin drawled out, with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Is it good?&rdquo; asked Foma, looking at his godfather suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not know what is good; but we can see what is wise. When we see
      that all sorts of people are driven together in one place and are all
      inspired there with one and the same idea&mdash;then must we acknowledge
      that it is wise. Because&mdash;what is a man in the empire? Nothing more
      than a simple brick, and all bricks must be of the same size. Do you
      understand? And those people that are of equal height and weight&mdash;I
      can place in any position I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whom does it please to be a brick?&rdquo; said Foma, morosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a question of pleasing, it is a matter of fact. If you are made
      of hard material, they cannot plane you. It is not everybody&rsquo;s phiz that
      you can rub off. But some people, when beaten with a hammer, turn into
      gold. And if the head happens to crack&mdash;what can you do? It merely
      shows it was weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He also spoke about toil. &lsquo;Everything,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;is done by machinery,
      and thus are men spoiled.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is out of his wits!&rdquo; Mayakin waved his hand disdainfully. &ldquo;I am
      surprised, what an appetite you have for all sorts of nonsense! What does
      it come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that true, either?&rdquo; asked Foma, breaking into stern laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What true thing can he know? A machine! The old blockhead should have
      thought&mdash;&lsquo;what is the machine made of?&rsquo; Of iron! Consequently, it
      need not be pitied; it is wound up&mdash;and it forges roubles for you.
      Without any words, without trouble, you set it into motion and it
      revolves. While a man, he is uneasy and wretched; he is often very
      wretched. He wails, grieves, weeps, begs. Sometimes he gets drunk. Ah, how
      much there is in him that is superfluous to me! While a machine is like an
      arshin (yardstick), it contains exactly so much as the work required.
      Well, I am going to dress. It is time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and went away, loudly scraping with his slippers along the floor.
      Foma glanced after him and said softly, with a frown:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil himself could not see through all this. One says this, the
      other, that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is precisely the same with books,&rdquo; said Lubov in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma looked at her, smiling good-naturedly. And she answered him with a
      vague smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes looked fatigued and sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You still keep on reading?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl answered sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you still lonesome?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel disgusted, because I am alone. There&rsquo;s no one here to say a word
      to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing to this, but, lowering her head, she slowly began to
      finger the fringes of the towel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to get married,&rdquo; said Foma, feeling that he pitied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me alone, please,&rdquo; answered Lubov, wrinkling her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why leave you alone? You will get married, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl softly, with a sigh. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I am
      thinking of&mdash;it is necessary. That is, I&rsquo;ll have to get married. But
      how? Do you know, I feel now as though a mist stood between other people
      and myself&mdash;a thick, thick mist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s from your books,&rdquo; Foma interposed confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! And I cease to understand what is going on about me. Nothing
      pleases me. Everything has become strange to me. Nothing is as it should
      be. Everything is wrong. I see it. I understand it, yet I cannot say that
      it is wrong, and why it is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not so, not so,&rdquo; muttered Foma. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s from your books. Yes.
      Although I also feel that it&rsquo;s wrong. Perhaps that is because we are so
      young and foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first it seemed to me,&rdquo; said Lubov, not listening to him, &ldquo;that
      everything in the books was clear to me. But now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop your books,&rdquo; suggested Foma, with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t say that! How can I drop them? You know how many different
      ideas there are in the world! O Lord! They&rsquo;re such ideas that set your
      head afire. According to a certain book everything that exists on earth is
      rational.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything! While another book says the contrary is true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! Now isn&rsquo;t this nonsense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you discussing?&rdquo; asked Mayakin, appearing at the door, in a
      long frock-coat and with several medals on his collar and his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; said Lubov, morosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We spoke about books,&rdquo; added Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The books she is reading. She read that everything on earth is rational.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and I say it is a lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Yakov Tarasovich became thoughtful, he pinched his beard and winked
      his eyes a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a book is it?&rdquo; he asked his daughter, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little yellow-covered book,&rdquo; said Lubov, unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just put that book on my table. That is said not without reflection&mdash;everything
      on earth is rational! See someone thought of it. Yes. It is even very
      cleverly expressed. And were it not for the fools, it might have been
      perfectly correct. But as fools are always in the wrong place, it cannot
      be said that everything on earth is rational. And yet, I&rsquo;ll look at the
      book. Maybe there is common sense in it. Goodbye, Foma! Will you stay
      here, or do you want to drive with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here a little longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov and Foma again remained alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a man your father is,&rdquo; said Foma, nodding his head toward the
      direction of his godfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what kind of a man do you think he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He retorts every call, and wants to cover everything with his words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is clever. And yet he does not understand how painful my life
      is,&rdquo; said Lubov, sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither do I understand it. You imagine too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do I imagine?&rdquo; cried the girl, irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, all these are not your own ideas. They are someone else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone else&rsquo;s. Someone else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt like saying something harsh; but broke down and became silent.
      Foma looked at her and, setting Medinskaya by her side, thought sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How different everything is&mdash;both men and women&mdash;and you never
      feel alike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat opposite each other; both were lost in thought, and neither one
      looked at the other. It was getting dark outside, and in the room it was
      quite dark already. The wind was shaking the linden-trees, and their
      branches seemed to clutch at the walls of the house, as though they felt
      cold and implored for shelter in the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luba!&rdquo; said Foma, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head and looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, I have quarrelled with Medinskaya.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Luba, brightening up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So. It came about that she offended me. Yes, she offended me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;ve quarrelled with her,&rdquo; said the girl,
      approvingly, &ldquo;for she would have turned your head. She is a vile creature;
      she is a coquette, even worse than that. Oh, what things I know about
      her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not at all a vile creature,&rdquo; said Foma, morosely. &ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t
      know anything about her. You are all lying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I beg your pardon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. See here, Luba,&rdquo; said Foma, softly, in a beseeching tone, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      speak ill of her in my presence. It isn&rsquo;t necessary. I know everything. By
      God! She told me everything herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herself!&rdquo; exclaimed Luba, in astonishment. &ldquo;What a strange woman she is!
      What did she tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That she is guilty,&rdquo; Foma ejaculated with difficulty, with a wry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; There was a ring of disappointment in the girl&rsquo;s question;
      Foma heard it and asked hopefully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I am thinking about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love her very much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma was silent. He looked into the window and answered confusedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But it seems to me that now I love her more than before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than before the quarrel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how one can love such a woman!&rdquo; said the girl, shrugging her
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love such a woman? Of course! Why not?&rdquo; exclaimed Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it. I think, you have become attached to her just
      because you have not met a better woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not met a better one!&rdquo; Foma assented, and after a moment&rsquo;s
      silence said shyly, &ldquo;Perhaps there is none better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among our people,&rdquo; Lubov interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need her very badly! Because, you see, I feel ashamed before her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in general, I fear her; that is, I would not want her to think ill of
      me, as of others. Sometimes I feel disgusted. I think&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t it be
      a great idea to go out on such a spree that all my veins would start
      tingling. And then I recall her and I do not venture. And so everything
      else, I think of her, &lsquo;What if she finds it out?&rsquo; and I am afraid to do
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl drawled out thoughtfully, &ldquo;that shows that you love her. I
      would also be like this. If I loved, I would think of him&mdash;of what he
      might say...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And everything about her is so peculiar,&rdquo; Foma related softly. &ldquo;She
      speaks in a way all her own. And, God! How beautiful she is! And then she
      is so small, like a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what took place between you?&rdquo; asked Lubov.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma moved his chair closer to her, and stooping, he lowered his voice for
      some reason or other, and began to relate to her all that had taken place
      between him and Medinskaya. He spoke, and as he recalled the words he said
      to Medinskaya, the sentiments that called forth the words were also
      awakened in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told her, &lsquo;Oh, you! why did you make sport of me?&rsquo;&rdquo; he said angrily and
      with reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Luba, her cheeks aflame with animation, spurred him on, nodding her
      head approvingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! That&rsquo;s good! Well, and she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was silent!&rdquo; said Foma, sadly, with a shrug of the shoulders. &ldquo;That
      is, she said different things; but what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waved his hand and became silent. Luba, playing with her braid, was
      also silent. The samovar had already become cold. And the dimness in the
      room was growing thicker and thicker, outside the window it was heavy with
      darkness, and the black branches of the linden-trees were shaking
      pensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might light the lamp,&rdquo; Foma went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How unhappy we both are,&rdquo; said Luba, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma did not like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not unhappy,&rdquo; he objected in a firm voice. &ldquo;I am simply&mdash;not
      yet accustomed to life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who knows not what he is going to do tomorrow, is unhappy,&rdquo; said Luba,
      sadly. &ldquo;I do not know it, neither do you. Whither go? Yet go we must, Why
      is it that my heart is never at ease? Some kind of a longing is always
      quivering within it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the same with me,&rdquo; said Foma. &ldquo;I start to reflect, but on what? I
      cannot make it clear to myself. There is also a painful gnawing in my
      heart. Eh! But I must go up to the club.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away,&rdquo; Luba entreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must. Somebody is waiting there for me. I am going. Goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till we meet again!&rdquo; She held out her hand to him and sadly looked into
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go to sleep now?&rdquo; asked Foma, firmly shaking her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re to your books as the drunkard to his whisky,&rdquo; said the youth, with
      pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there that is better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Walking along the street he looked at the windows of the house and in one
      of them he noticed Luba&rsquo;s face. It was just as vague as everything that
      the girl told him, even as vague as her longings. Foma nodded his head
      toward her and with a consciousness of his superiority over her, thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has also lost her way, like the other one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this recollection he shook his head, as though he wanted to frighten
      away the thought of Medinskaya, and quickened his steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night was coming on, and the air was fresh. A cold, invigorating wind was
      violently raging in the street, driving the dust along the sidewalks and
      throwing it into the faces of the passers-by. It was dark, and people were
      hastily striding along in the darkness. Foma wrinkled his face, for the
      dust filled his eyes, and thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is a woman I meet now&mdash;then it will mean that Sophya Pavlovna
      will receive me in a friendly way, as before. I am going to see her
      tomorrow. And if it is a man&mdash;I won&rsquo;t go tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But it was a dog that came to meet him, and this irritated Foma to such an
      extent that he felt like striking him with his cane.
    </p>

      In the refreshment-room of the club, Foma was met by the jovial
      Ookhtishchev. He stood at the door, and chatted with a certain stout,
      whiskered man; but, noticing Gordyeeff, he came forward to meet him,
      saying, with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, modest millionaire!&rdquo; Foma rather liked him for his jolly
      mood, and was always pleased to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firmly and kind-heartedly shaking Ookhtishchev&rsquo;s hand, Foma asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what makes you think that I am modest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a question! A man, who lives like a hermit, who neither drinks, nor
      plays, nor likes any women. By the way, do you know, Foma Ignatyevich,
      that peerless patroness of ours is going abroad tomorrow for the whole
      summer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophya Pavlovna?&rdquo; asked Foma, slowly. &ldquo;Of course! The sun of my life is
      setting. And, perhaps, of yours as well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ookhtishchev made a comical, sly grimace and looked into Foma&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Foma stood before him, feeling that his head was lowering on his
      breast, and that he was unable to hinder it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the radiant Aurora.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Medinskaya going away?&rdquo; a deep bass voice asked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine! I am
      glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I know why?&rdquo; exclaimed Ookhtishchev. Foma smiled sheepishly and
      stared in confusion at the whiskered man, Ookhtishchev&rsquo;s interlocutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      That man was stroking his moustache with an air of importance, and deep,
      heavy, repulsive words fell from his lips on Foma&rsquo;s ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, you see, there will be one co-cot-te less in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame, Martin Nikitich!&rdquo; said Ookhtishchev, reproachfully, knitting his
      brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know that she is a coquette?&rdquo; asked Foma, sternly, coming
      closer to the whiskered man. The man measured him with a scornful look,
      turned aside and moving his thigh, drawled out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say&mdash;coquette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Martin Nikitich, you mustn&rsquo;t speak that way about a woman who&mdash;&rdquo;
       began Ookhtishchev in a convincing tone, but Foma interrupted him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, just a moment! I wish to ask the gentleman, what is the
      meaning of the word he said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he articulated this firmly and calmly, Foma thrust his hands deep
      into his trousers-pockets, threw his chest forward, which at once gave his
      figure an attitude of defiance. The whiskered gentleman again eyed Foma
      with a sarcastic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; exclaimed Ookhtishchev, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said, co-cot-te,&rdquo; pronounced the whiskered man, moving his lips as if
      he tasted the word. &ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t understand it, I can explain it to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better explain it,&rdquo; said Foma, with a deep sigh, not lifting his
      eyes off the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ookhtishchev clasped his hands and rushed aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A cocotte, if you want to know it, is a prostitute,&rdquo; said the whiskered
      man in a low voice, moving his big, fat face closer to Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma gave a soft growl and, before the whiskered man had time to move
      away, he clutched with his right hand his curly, grayish hair. With a
      convulsive movement of the hand, Foma began to shake the man&rsquo;s head and
      his big, solid body; lifting up his left hand, he spoke in a dull voice,
      keeping time to the punishment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t abuse a person&mdash;in his absence. Abuse him&mdash;right in his
      face&mdash;straight in his eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He experienced a burning delight, seeing how comically the stout arms were
      swinging in the air, and how the legs of the man, whom he was shaking,
      were bending under him, scraping against the floor. His gold watch fell
      out of the pocket and dangled on the chain, over his round paunch.
      Intoxicated with his own strength and with the degradation of the sedate
      man, filled with the burning feeling of malignancy, trembling with the
      happiness of revenge, Foma dragged him along the floor and in a dull
      voice, growled wickedly, in wild joy. In these moments he experienced a
      great feeling&mdash;the feeling of emancipation from the wearisome burden
      which had long oppressed his heart with grief and morbidness. He felt that
      he was seized by the waist and shoulders from behind, that someone seized
      his hand and bent it, trying to break it; that someone was crushing his
      toes; but he saw nothing, following with his bloodshot eyes the dark,
      heavy mass moaning and wriggling in his hand. Finally, they tore him away
      and downed him, and, as through a reddish mist, he noticed before him on
      the floor, at his feet, the man he had thrashed. Dishevelled, he was
      moving his legs over the floor, attempting to rise; two dark men were
      holding him by the arms, his hands were dangling in the air like broken
      wings, and, in a voice that was choking with sobs, he cried to Foma:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t beat me! You mustn&rsquo;t! I have an...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order. You rascal! Oh, rascal! I have children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody knows me! Scoundrel! Savage, O&mdash;O&mdash;O! You may expect
      a duel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ookhtishchev spoke loudly in Foma&rsquo;s ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my dear boy, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll give him a kick in the face,&rdquo; begged Foma. But he was dragged
      off. There was a buzzing in his ears, his heart beat fast, but he felt
      relieved and well. At the entrance of the club he heaved a deep sigh of
      relief and said to Ookhtishchev, with a good-natured smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave him a sound drubbing, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; exclaimed the gay secretary, indignantly. &ldquo;You must pardon me
      but that was the act of a savage! The devil take it. I never witnessed
      such a thing before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear man!&rdquo; said Foma, friendly, &ldquo;did he not deserve the drubbing? Is
      he not a scoundrel? How can he speak like that behind a person&rsquo;s back? No!
      Let him go to her and tell it plainly to her alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me. The devil take you! But it wasn&rsquo;t for her alone that you gave
      him the drubbing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, what do you mea,&mdash;not for her alone? For whom then?&rdquo; asked
      Foma, amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For whom? I don&rsquo;t know. Evidently you had old accounts to settle! Oh
      Lord! That was a scene! I shall not forget it in all my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&mdash;that man&mdash;who is he?&rdquo; asked Foma, and suddenly burst out
      laughing. &ldquo;How he roared, the fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ookhtishchev looked fixedly into his face and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, is it true, that you don&rsquo;t know whom you&rsquo;ve thrashed? And is it
      really only for Sophya Pavlovna?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, by God!&rdquo; avowed Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, the devil knows what the result may be!&rdquo; He stopped short, shrugged
      his shoulders perplexedly, waved his hand, and again began to pace the
      sidewalk, looking at Foma askance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for this, Foma
      Ignatyevich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he take me to court?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would to God he does. He is the Vice-Governor&rsquo;s son-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; said Foma, slowly, and made a long face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. To tell the truth, he is a scoundrel and a rascal. According to this
      fact I must admit, that he deserves a drubbing. But taking into
      consideration the fact that the lady you defended is also&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Foma, firmly, placing his hand on Ookhtishchev&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;I
      have always liked you, and you are now walking with me. I understand it
      and can appreciate it. But do not speak ill of her in my presence.
      Whatever she may be in your opinion, in my opinion, she is dear to me. To
      me she is the best woman. So I am telling you frankly. Since you are going
      with me, do not touch her. I consider her good, therefore she is good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was great emotion in Foma&rsquo;s voice. Ookhtishchev looked at him and
      said thoughtfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a queer man, I must confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a simple man&mdash;a savage. I have given him a thrashing and now I
      feel jolly, and as to the result, let come what will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid that it will result in something bad. Do you know&mdash;to be
      frank, in return for your frankness&mdash;I also like you, although&mdash;Mm!
      It is rather dangerous to be with you. Such a knightly temper may come
      over you and one may get a thrashing at your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? This was but the first time. I am not going to beat people every
      day, am I?&rdquo; said Foma, confused. His companion began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a monster you are! Listen to me&mdash;it is savage to fight&mdash;you
      must excuse me, but it is abominable. Yet, I must tell you, in this case
      you made a happy selection. You have thrashed a rake, a cynic, a parasite&mdash;a
      man who robbed his nephews with impunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thank God for that!&rdquo; said Foma with satisfaction. &ldquo;Now I have
      punished him a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little? Very well, let us suppose it was a little. But listen to me, my
      child, permit me to give you advice. I am a man of the law. He, that
      Kayazev, is a rascal! True! But you must not thrash even a rascal, for he
      is a social being, under the paternal custody of the law. You cannot touch
      him until he transgresses the limits of the penal code. But even then, not
      you, but we, the judges, will give him his due. While you must have
      patience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will he soon fall into your hands?&rdquo; inquired Foma, naively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is hard to tell. Being far from stupid, he will probably never be
      caught, and to the end of his days he will live with you and me in the
      same degree of equality before the law. Oh God, what I am telling you!&rdquo;
       said Ookhtishchev, with a comical sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betraying secrets?&rdquo; grinned Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t secrets; but I ought not to be frivolous. De-e-evil! But then,
      this affair enlivened me. Indeed, Nemesis is even then true to herself
      when she simply kicks like a horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma stopped suddenly, as though he had met an obstacle on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nemesis&mdash;the goddess of Justice,&rdquo; babbled Ookhtishchev. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it all came about,&rdquo; said Foma, slowly, in a dull voice, &ldquo;because you
      said that she was going away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophya Pavlovna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she is going away. Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood opposite Foma and stared at him, with a smile in his eyes.
      Gordyeeff was silent, with lowered head, tapping the stone of the sidewalk
      with his cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Ookhtishchev.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma started, saying indifferently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let her go. And I am alone.&rdquo; Ookhtishchev, waving his cane, began
      to whistle, looking at his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t I be able to get along without her?&rdquo; asked Foma, looking
      somewhere in front of him and then, after a pause, he answered himself
      softly and irresolutely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me!&rdquo; exclaimed Ookhtishchev. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you some good advice. A
      man must be himself. While you, you are an epic man, so to say, and the
      lyrical is not becoming to you. It isn&rsquo;t your genre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak to me more simply, sir,&rdquo; said Foma, having listened attentively to
      his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More simply? Very well. I want to say, give up thinking of this little
      lady. She is poisonous food for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me the same,&rdquo; put in Foma, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told you?&rdquo; Ookhtishchev asked and became thoughtful. &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll tell
      you, shouldn&rsquo;t we perhaps go and have supper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Foma assented. And he suddenly roared obdurately, clinching
      his fists and waving them in the air: &ldquo;Well, let us go, and I&rsquo;ll get wound
      up; I&rsquo;ll break loose, after all this, so you can&rsquo;t hold me back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? We&rsquo;ll do it modestly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! wait!&rdquo; said Foma, anxiously, seizing him by the shoulder. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
      that? Am I worse than other people? Everybody lives, whirls, hustles
      about, has his own point. While I am weary. Everybody is satisfied with
      himself. And as to their complaining, they lie, the rascals! They are
      simply pretending for beauty&rsquo;s sake. I have no reason to pretend. I am a
      fool. I don&rsquo;t understand anything, my dear fellow. I simply wish to live!
      I am unable to think. I feel disgusted; one says this, another that!
      Pshaw! But she, eh! If you knew. My hope was in her. I expected of her&mdash;just
      what I expected, I cannot tell; but she is the best of women! And I had so
      much faith in her&mdash;when sometimes she spoke such peculiar words, all
      her own. Her eyes, my dear boy, are so beautiful! Oh Lord! I was ashamed
      to look upon them, and as I am telling you, she would say a few words, and
      everything would become clear to me. For I did not come to her with love
      alone&mdash;I came to her with all my soul! I sought&mdash;I thought that
      since she was so beautiful, consequently, I might become a man by her
      side!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ookhtishchev listened to the painful, unconnected words that burst from
      his companion&rsquo;s lips. He saw how the muscles of his face contracted with
      the effort to express his thoughts, and he felt that behind this bombast
      there was a great, serious grief. There was something intensely pathetic
      in the powerlessness of this strong and savage youth, who suddenly started
      to pace the sidewalk with big, uneven steps. Skipping along after him with
      his short legs, Ookhtishchev felt it his duty somehow to calm Foma.
      Everything Foma had said and done that evening awakened in the jolly
      secretary a feeling of lively curiosity toward Foma, and then he felt
      flattered by the frankness of the young millionaire. This frankness
      confused him with its dark power; he was disconcerted by its pressure, and
      though, in spite of his youth, he had a stock of words ready for all
      occasions in life, it took him quite awhile to recall them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel that everything is dark and narrow about me,&rdquo; said Gordyeeff. &ldquo;I
      feel that a burden is falling on my shoulders, but what it is I cannot
      understand! It puts a restraint on me, and it checks the freedom of my
      movements along the road of life. Listening to people, you hear that each
      says a different thing. But she could have said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, my dear boy!&rdquo; Ookhtishchev interrupted Foma, gently taking his arm.
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t right! You have just started to live and already you are
      philosophizing! No, that is not right! Life is given us to live! Which
      means&mdash;live and let others live. That&rsquo;s the philosophy! And that
      woman. Bah! Is she then the only one in the world? The world is large
      enough. If you wish, I&rsquo;ll introduce you to such a virile woman, that even
      the slightest trace of your philosophy would at once vanish from your
      soul! Oh, a remarkable woman! And how well she knows how to avail herself
      of life! Do you know, there&rsquo;s also something epic about her? She is
      beautiful; a Phryne, I may say, and what a match she would be to you! Ah,
      devil! It is really a splendid idea. I&rsquo;ll make you acquainted with her! We
      must drive one nail out with another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My conscience does not allow it,&rdquo; said Foma, sadly and sternly. &ldquo;So long
      as she is alive, I cannot even look at women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a robust and healthy young man. Ho, ho!&rdquo; exclaimed Ookhtishchev, and
      in the tone of a teacher began to argue with Foma that it was essential
      for him to give his passion an outlet in a good spree, in the company of
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This will be magnificent, and it is indispensable to you. You may believe
      me. And as to conscience, you must excuse me. You don&rsquo;t define it quite
      properly. It is not conscience that interferes with you, but timidity, I
      believe. You live outside of society. You are bashful, and awkward. Youare
      dimly conscious of all this, and it is this consciousness that you mistake
      for conscience. In this case there can be no question about conscience.
      What has conscience to do here, since it is natural for man to enjoy
      himself, since it is his necessity and his right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma walked on, regulating his steps to those of his companion, and
      staring along the road, which lay between two rows of buildings, resembled
      an enormous ditch, and was filled with darkness. It seemed that there was
      no end to the road and that something dark, inexhaustible and suffocating
      was slowly flowing along it in the distance. Ookhtishchev&rsquo;s kind, suasive
      voice rang monotonously in Foma&rsquo;s ears, and though he was not listening to
      his words, he felt that they were tenacious in their way; that they
      adhered to him, and that he was involuntarily memorizing them.
      Notwithstanding that a man walked beside him, he felt as though he were
      alone, straying in the dark. And the darkness seized him and slowly drew
      him along, and he felt that he was drawn somewhere, and yet had no desire
      to stop. Some sort of fatigue hindered his thinking; there was no desire
      in him to resist the admonitions of his companion&mdash;and why should he
      resist them?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t for everyone to philosophize,&rdquo; said Ookhtishchev, swinging his
      cane in the air, and somewhat carried away by his wisdom. &ldquo;For if
      everybody were to philosophize, who would live? And we live but once! And
      therefore it were best to make haste to live. By God! That&rsquo;s true! But
      what&rsquo;s the use of talking? Would you permit me to give you a shaking up?
      Let&rsquo;s go immediately to a pleasure-house I know. Two sisters live there.
      Ah, how they live! You will come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; said Foma, calmly, and yawned. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather late?&rdquo; he
      asked, looking up at the sky which was covered with clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never too late to go to see them!&rdquo; exclaimed Ookhtishchev, merrily.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      ON the third day after the scene in the club, Foma found himself about
      seven versts from the town, on the timber-wharf of the merchant Zvantzev,
      in the company of the merchant&rsquo;s son of Ookhtishchev&mdash;a sedate,
      bald-headed and red-nosed gentleman with side whiskers&mdash;and four
      ladies. The young Zvantzev wore eyeglasses, was thin and pale, and when he
      stood, the calves of his legs were forever trembling as though they were
      disgusted at supporting the feeble body, clad in a long, checked top-coat
      with a cape, in whose folds a small head in a jockey cap was comically
      shaking. The gentleman with the side whiskers called him Jean and
      pronounced this name as though he was suffering from an inveterate cold.
      Jean&rsquo;s lady was a tall, stout woman with a showy bust. Her head was
      compressed on the sides, her low forehead receded, her long, sharp-pointed
      nose gave her face an expression somewhat bird-like. And this ugly face
      was perfectly motionless, and the eyes alone, small, round and cold, were
      forever smiling a penetrating and cunning smile. Ookhtishchev&rsquo;s lady&rsquo;s
      name was Vera; she was a tall, pale woman with red hair. She had so much
      hair, that it seemed as though the woman had put on her head an enormous
      cap which was coming down over her ears, her cheeks and her high forehead,
      from under which her large blue eyes looked forth calmly and lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman with the side whiskers sat beside a young, plump, buxom
      girl, who constantly giggled in a ringing voice at something which he
      whispered in her ear as he leaned over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Foma&rsquo;s lady was a stately brunette, clad all in black.
      Dark-complexioned, with wavy locks, she kept her head so erect and high
      and looked at everything about her with such condescending haughtiness,
      that it was at once evident that she considered herself the most important
      person there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company were seated on the extreme link of the raft, extending far
      into the smooth expanse of the river. Boards were spread out on the raft
      and in the centre stood a crudely constructed table; empty bottles,
      provision baskets, candy-wrappers and orange peels were scattered about
      everywhere. In the corner of the raft was a pile of earth, upon which a
      bonfire was burning, and a peasant in a short fur coat, squatting, warmed
      his hands over the fire, and cast furtive glances at the people seated
      around the table. They had just finished eating their sturgeon soup, and
      now wines and fruits were before them on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fatigued with a two-days&rsquo; spree and with the dinner that had just been
      finished, the company was in a weary frame of mind. They all gazed at the
      river, chatting, but their conversation was now and again interrupted by
      long pauses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was clear and bright and young, as in spring. The cold, clear sky
      stretched itself majestically over the turbid water of the
      gigantically-wide, overflowing river, which was as calm as the sky and as
      vast as the sea. The distant, mountainous shore was tenderly bathed in
      bluish mist. Through it, there, on the mountain tops, the crosses of
      churches were flashing like big stars. The river was animated at the
      mountainous shore; steamers were going hither and thither, and their noise
      came in deep moans toward the rafts and into the meadows, where the calm
      flow of the waves filled the air with soft and faint sounds. Gigantic
      barges stretched themselves one after another against the current, like
      huge pigs, tearing asunder the smooth expanse of the river. Black smoke
      came in ponderous puffs from the chimneys of the steamers, slowly melting
      in the fresh air, which was full of bright sunshine. At times a whistle
      resounded&mdash;it was like the roar of some huge, enraged animal,
      embittered by toil. And on the meadows near the rafts, all was calm and
      silent. Solitary trees that had been drowned by the flood, were now
      already covered with light-green spangles of foliage. Covering their roots
      and reflecting their tops, the water gave them the appearance of globes,
      and it seemed as though the slightest breeze would send them floating,
      fantastically beautiful, down the mirror-like bosom of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-haired woman, pensively gazing into the distance, began to sing
      softly and sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Along the Volga river A little boat is flo-o-oating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The brunette, snapping her large, stern eyes with contempt, said, without
      looking at her: &ldquo;We feel gloomy enough without this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch her. Let her sing!&rdquo; entreated Foma, kindly, looking into his
      lady&rsquo;s face. He was pale some spark seemed to flash up in his eyes now and
      then, and an indefinite, indolent smile played about his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us sing in chorus!&rdquo; suggested the man with the side whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, let these two sing!&rdquo; exclaimed Ookhtishchev with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Vera,
      sing that song! You know, &lsquo;I will go at dawn.&rsquo; How is it? Sing, Pavlinka!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The giggling girl glanced at the brunette and asked her respectfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I sing, Sasha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall sing myself,&rdquo; announced Foma&rsquo;s companion, and turning toward the
      lady with the birdlike face, she ordered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vassa, sing with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vassa immediately broke off her conversation with Zvantzev, stroked her
      throat a little with her hand and fixed her round eyes on the face of her
      sister. Sasha rose to her feet, leaned her hand against the table, and her
      head lifted haughtily, began to declaim in a powerful, almost masculine
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life on earth is bright to him, Who knows no cares or woe, And whose
      heart is not consumed By passion&rsquo;s ardent glow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her sister nodded her head and slowly, plaintively began to moan in a deep
      contralto:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah me! Of me the maiden fair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Flashing her eyes at her sister, Sasha exclaimed in her low-pitched notes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a blade of grass my heart has withered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two voices mingled and floated over the water in melodious, full
      sounds, which quivered from excess of power. One of them was complaining
      of the unbearable pain in the heart, and intoxicated by the poison of its
      plaint, it sobbed with melancholy and impotent grief; sobbed, quenching
      with tears the fire of the suffering. The other&mdash;the lower, more
      masculine voice&mdash;rolled powerfully through the air, full of the
      feeling of bloody mortification and of readiness to avenge. Pronouncing
      the words distinctly, the voice came from her breast in a deep stream, and
      each word reeked with boiling blood, stirred up by outrage, poisoned by
      offence and mightily demanding vengeance.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I will requite him,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      sang Vassa, plaintively, closing her eyes.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;I will inflame him,
     I&rsquo;ll dry him up,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Sasha promised sternly and confidently, wafting into the air strong,
      powerful tones, which sounded like blows. And suddenly, changing the tempo
      of the song and striking a higher pitch, she began to sing, as slowly as
      her sister, voluptuous and exultant threats:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drier than the raging wind, Drier than the mown-down grass, Oi, the mown
      and dried-up grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Resting his elbows on the table, Foma bent his head, and with knitted
      brow, gazed into the face of the woman, into her black, half-shut eyes
      Staring fixedly into the distance, her eyes flashed so brightly and
      malignantly that, because of their light, the velvety voice, that burst
      from the woman&rsquo;s chest, seemed to him also black and flashing, like her
      eyes. He recalled her caresses and thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does she come to be such as she is? It is even fearful to be with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ookhtishchev, sitting close to his lady, an expression of happiness on his
      face, listened to the song and was radiant with satisfaction. The
      gentleman with the side whiskers and Zvantzev were drinking wine, softly
      whispering something as they leaned toward each other. The red-headed
      woman was thoughtfully examining the palm of Ookhtishchev&rsquo;s hand, holding
      it in her own, and the jolly girl became sad. She drooped her head low and
      listened to the song, motionless, as though bewitched by it. From the fire
      came the peasant. He stepped carefully over the boards, on tiptoe; his
      hands were clasped behind his back, and his broad, bearded face was now
      transformed into a smile of astonishment and of a naive delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! but feel, my kind, brave man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      entreated Vassa, plaintively, nodding her head. And her sister, her chest
      bent forward, her hand still higher, wound up the song in powerful
      triumphant notes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The yearning and the pangs of love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she finished singing, she looked haughtily about her, and seating
      herself by Foma&rsquo;s side, clasped his neck with a firm and powerful hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, was it a nice song?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s capital!&rdquo; said Foma with a sigh, as he smiled at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The song filled his heart with thirst for tenderness and, still full of
      charming sounds, it quivered, but at the touch of her arm he felt awkward
      and ashamed before the other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo-o! Bravo, Aleksandra Sarelyevna!&rdquo; shouted Ookhtishchev, and the
      others were clapping their hands. But she paid no attention to them, and
      embracing Foma authoritatively, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, make me a present of something for the song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will,&rdquo; Foma assented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when we come to town. And if you&rsquo;ll give me what I like&mdash;Oh,
      how I will love you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the present?&rdquo; asked Foma, smiling suspiciously. &ldquo;You ought to love me
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him calmly and, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, said resolutely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too soon to love you anyway. I will not lie. Why should I lie to
      you? I am telling you frankly. I love you for money, for presents. Because
      aside from money, men have nothing. They cannot give anything more than
      money. Nothing of worth. I know it well already. One can love merely so.
      Yes, wait a little&mdash;I&rsquo;ll know you better and then, perhaps, I may
      love you free of charge. And meanwhile, you mustn&rsquo;t take me amiss. I need
      much money in my mode of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma listened to her, smiled and now and then quivered from the nearness
      of her sound, well-shaped body. Zvantzev&rsquo;s sour, cracked and boring voice
      was falling on his ears. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it. I cannot understand the beauty
      of this renowned Russian song. What is it that sounds in it? Eh? The howl
      of a wolf. Something hungry, wild. Eh! it&rsquo;s the groan of a sick dog&mdash;altogether
      something beastly. There&rsquo;s nothing cheerful, there&rsquo;s no chic to it; there
      are no live and vivifying sounds in it. No, you ought to hear what and how
      the French peasant sings. Ah! or the Italian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Ivan Nikolayevich,&rdquo; cried Ookhtishchev, agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must agree with you, the Russian song is monotonous and gloomy. It has
      not, you know, that brilliancy of culture,&rdquo; said the man with the side
      whiskers wearily, as he sipped some wine out of his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nevertheless, there is always a warm heart in it,&rdquo; put in the
      red-haired lady, as she peeled an orange.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was setting. Sinking somewhere far beyond the forest, on the
      meadow shore, it painted the entire forest with purple tints and cast rosy
      and golden spots over the dark cold water. Foma gazed in that direction at
      this play of the sunbeams, watched how they quivered as they were
      transposed over the placid and vast expanse of waters, and catching
      fragments of conversation, he pictured to himself the words as a swarm of
      dark butterflies, busily fluttering in the air. Sasha, her head resting on
      his shoulder, was softly whispering into his ear something at which he
      blushed and was confused, for he felt that she was kindling in him the
      desire to embrace this woman and kiss her unceasingly. Aside from her,
      none of those assembled there interested him&mdash;while Zvantzev and the
      gentleman with the side whiskers were actually repulsive to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you staring at? Eh?&rdquo; he heard Ookhtishchev&rsquo;s jestingly-stern
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasant, at whom Ookhtishchev shouted, drew the cap from his head,
      clapped it against his knee and answered, with a smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came over to listen to the lady&rsquo;s song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, does she sing well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a question! Of course,&rdquo; said the peasant, looking at Sasha, with
      admiration in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; exclaimed Ookhtishchev.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a great power of voice in that lady&rsquo;s breast,&rdquo; said the peasant,
      nodding his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his words, the ladies burst out laughing and the men made some
      double-meaning remarks about Sasha.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had calmly listened to these and said nothing in reply, Sasha
      asked the peasant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you sing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We sing a little!&rdquo; and he waved his hand, &ldquo;What songs do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All kinds. I love singing.&rdquo; And he smiled apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s sing something together, you and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we? Am I a match for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, strike up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I sit down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come over here, to the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How lively this is!&rdquo; exclaimed Zvantzev, wrinkling his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you find it tedious, go and drown yourself,&rdquo; said Sasha, angrily
      flashing her eyes at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the water is cold,&rdquo; replied Zvantzev, shrinking at her glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you please!&rdquo; The woman shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;But it is about time
      you did it, and then, there&rsquo;s also plenty of water now, so that you
      wouldn&rsquo;t spoil it all with your rotten body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie, how witty!&rdquo; hissed the youth, turning away from her, and added with
      contempt: &ldquo;In Russia even the prostitutes are rude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He addressed himself to his neighbour, but the latter gave him only an
      intoxicated smile in return. Ookhtishchev was also drunk. Staring into the
      face of his companion, with his eyes grown dim, he muttered something and
      heard nothing. The lady with the bird-like face was pecking candy, holding
      the box under her very nose. Pavlinka went away to the edge of the raft
      and, standing there, threw orange peels into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never before participated in such an absurd outing and&mdash;company,&rdquo;
       said Zvantzev, to his neighbour, plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Foma watched him with a smile, delighted that this feeble and
      ugly-looking man felt bored, and that Sasha had insulted him. Now and then
      he cast at her a kind glance of approval. He was pleased with the fact
      that she was so frank with everybody and that she bore herself proudly,
      like a real gentlewoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasant seated himself on the boards at her feet, clasped his knees in
      his hands, lifted his face to her and seriously listened to her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must raise your voice, when I lower mine, understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand; but, Madam, you ought to hand me some just to give me
      courage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foma, give him a glass of brandy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And when the peasant emptied it, cleared his throat with pleasure, licked
      his lips and said: &ldquo;Now, I can do it,&rdquo; she ordered, knitting her brow:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasant made a wry mouth, lifted his eyes to her face, and started in
      a high-pitched tenor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot drink, I cannot eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trembling in every limb, the woman sobbed out tremulously, with strange
      sadness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wine cannot gladden my soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasant smiled sweetly, tossed his head to and fro, and closing his
      eyes, poured out into the air a tremulous wave of high-pitched notes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, time has come for me to bid goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the woman, shuddering and writhing, moaned and wailed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oi, from my kindred I must part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lowering his voice and swaying to and fro, the peasant declaimed in a
      sing-song with a remarkably intense expression of anguish:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, to foreign lands I must depart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the two voices, yearning and sobbing, poured forth into the silence
      and freshness of the evening, everything about them seemed warmer and
      better; everything seemed to smile the sorrowful smile of sympathy on the
      anguish of the man whom an obscure power is tearing away from his native
      soil into some foreign place, where hard labour and degradation are in
      store for him. It seemed as though not the sounds, nor the song, but the
      burning tears of the human heart in which the plaint had surged up&mdash;it
      seemed as though these tears moistened the air. Wild grief and pain from
      the sores of body and soul, which were wearied in the struggle with stern
      life; intense sufferings from the wounds dealt to man by the iron hand of
      want&mdash;all this was invested in the simple, crude words and was tossed
      in ineffably melancholy sounds toward the distant, empty sky, which has no
      echo for anybody or anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma had stepped aside from the singers, and stared at them with a feeling
      akin to fright, and the song, in a huge wave, poured forth into his
      breast, and the wild power of grief, with which it had been invested,
      clutched his heart painfully. He felt that tears would soon gush from his
      breast, something was clogging his throat and his face was quivering. He
      dimly saw Sasha&rsquo;s black eyes; immobile and flashing gloomily, they seemed
      to him enormous and still growing larger and larger. And it seemed to him
      that it was not two persons who were singing&mdash;that everything about
      him was singing and sobbing, quivering and palpitating in torrents of
      sorrow, madly striving somewhere, shedding burning tears, and all&mdash;and
      all things living seemed clasped in one powerful embrace of despair. And
      it seemed to him that he, too, was singing in unison with all of them&mdash;with
      the people, the river and the distant shore, whence came plaintive moans
      that mingled with the song.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the peasant went down on his knees, and gazing at Sasha, waved his
      hands, and she bent down toward him and shook her head, keeping time to
      the motions of his hands. Both were now singing without words, with sounds
      only, and Foma still could not believe that only two voices were pouring
      into the air these moans and sobs with such mighty power.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had finished singing, Foma, trembling with excitement, with a
      tear-stained face, gazed at them and smiled sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did it move you?&rdquo; asked Sasha. Pale with fatigue, she breathed
      quickly and heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma glanced at the peasant. The latter was wiping the sweat off his brow
      and looking around him with such a wandering look as though he could not
      make out what had taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was silence. All were motionless and speechless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord!&rdquo; sighed Foma, rising to his feet. &ldquo;Eh, Sasha! Peasant! Who are
      you?&rdquo; he almost shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am&mdash;Stepan,&rdquo; said the peasant, smiling confusedly, and also rose
      to his feet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Stepan. Of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How you sing! Ah!&rdquo; Foma exclaimed in astonishment, uneasily shifting from
      foot to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, your Honour!&rdquo; sighed the peasant and added softly and convincingly:
      &ldquo;Sorrow can compel an ox to sing like a nightingale. And what makes the
      lady sing like this, only God knows. And she sings, with all her veins&mdash;that
      is to say, so you might just lie down and die with sorrow! Well, that&rsquo;s a
      lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was sung very well!&rdquo; said Ookhtishchev in a drunken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the devil knows what this is!&rdquo; Zvantzev suddenly shouted, almost
      crying, irritated as he jumped up from the table. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come out here for
      a good time. I want to enjoy myself, and here they perform a funeral
      service for me! What an outrage! I can&rsquo;t stand this any longer. I&rsquo;m going
      away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean, I am also going. I&rsquo;m weary, too,&rdquo; announced the gentleman with the
      side whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vassa,&rdquo; cried Zvantzev to his lady, &ldquo;dress yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s time to go,&rdquo; said the red-haired lady to Ookhtishchev. &ldquo;It is
      cold, and it will soon be dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stepan! Clear everything away!&rdquo; commanded Vassa.
    </p>
    <p>
      All began to bustle about, all began to speak of something. Foma stared at
      them in suspense and shuddered. Staggering, the crowd walked along the
      rafts. Pale and fatigued, they said to one another stupid, disconnected
      things. Sasha jostled them unceremoniously, as she was getting her things
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stepan! Call for the horses!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll drink some more cognac. Who wants some more cognac with me?&rdquo;
       drawled the gentleman with the side whiskers in a beatific voice, holding
      a bottle in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vassa was muffling Zvantzev&rsquo;s neck with a scarf. He stood in front of her,
      frowning, dissatisfied, his lips curled capriciously, the calves of his
      legs shivering. Foma became disgusted as he looked at them, and he went
      off to the other raft. He was astonished that all these people behaved as
      though they had not heard the song at all. In his breast the song was
      alive and there it called to life a restless desire to do something, to
      say something. But he had no one there to speak to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had set and the distance was enveloped in blue mist. Foma glanced
      thither and turned away. He did not feel like going to town with these
      people, neither did he care to stay here with them. And they were still
      pacing the raft with uneven steps, shaking from side to side and muttering
      disconnected words. The women were not quite as drunk as the men, and only
      the red-haired one could not lift herself from the bench for a long time,
      and finally, when she rose, she declared:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m drunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma sat down on a log of wood, and lifting the axe, with which the
      peasant had chopped wood for the fire, he began to play with it, tossing
      it up in the air and catching it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God! How mean this is!&rdquo; Zvantzev&rsquo;s capricious voice was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma began to feel that he hated it, and him, and everybody, except Sasha,
      who awakened in him a certain uneasy feeling, which contained at once
      admiration for her and a fear lest she might do something unexpected and
      terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brute!&rdquo; shouted Zvantzev in a shrill voice, and Foma noticed that he
      struck the peasant on the chest, after which the peasant removed his cap
      humbly and stepped aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fo-o-ol!&rdquo; cried Zvantzev, walking after him and lifting his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma jumped to his feet and said threateningly, in a loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you! Don&rsquo;t touch him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha-a-at?&rdquo; Zvantzev turned around toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stepan, come over here,&rdquo; called Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peasant!&rdquo; Zvantzev hurled with contempt, looking at Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma shrugged his shoulders and made a step toward him; but suddenly a
      thought flashed vividly through his mind! He smiled maliciously and
      inquired of Stepan, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The string of rafts is moored in three places, isn&rsquo;t it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In three, of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut the connections!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet! Cut!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut! Quietly, so they don&rsquo;t notice it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasant took the axe in his hands, slowly walked up to the place where
      one link was well fastened to another link, struck a few times with his
      axe, and returned to Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not responsible, your Honour,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve started off,&rdquo; whispered the peasant with fright, and hastily made
      the sign of the cross. And Foma gazed, laughing softly, and experienced a
      painful sensation that keenly and sharply stung his heart with a certain
      strange, pleasant and sweet fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people on the raft were still pacing to and fro, moving about slowly,
      jostling one another, assisting the ladies with their wraps, laughing and
      talking, and the raft was meanwhile turning slowly and irresolutely in the
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the current carries them against the fleet,&rdquo; whispered the peasant,
      &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll strike against the bows&mdash;and they&rsquo;ll be smashed into
      splinters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll drown!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get a boat, and overtake them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Thank you. What then? They&rsquo;re after all human beings. And
      we&rsquo;ll be held responsible for them.&rdquo; Satisfied now, laughing with delight,
      the peasant dashed in bounds across the rafts to the shore. And Foma stood
      by the water and felt a passionate desire to shout something, but he
      controlled himself, in order to give time for the raft to float off
      farther, so that those drunken people would not be able to jump across to
      the moored links. He experienced a pleasant caressing sensation as he saw
      the raft softly rocking upon the water and floating off farther and
      farther from him every moment. The heavy and dark feeling, with which his
      heart had been filled during this time, now seemed to float away together
      with the people on the raft. Calmly he inhaled the fresh air and with it
      something sound that cleared his brain. At the very edge of the floating
      raft stood Sasha, with her back toward Foma; he looked at her beautiful
      figure and involuntarily recalled Medinskaya. The latter was smaller in
      size. The recollection of her stung him, and he cried out in a loud,
      mocking voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, there! Good-bye! Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the dark figures of the people moved toward him and crowded
      together in one group, in the centre of the raft. But by this time a clear
      strip of water, about three yards wide, was flashing between them and
      Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence lasting for a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly a hurricane of shrill, repulsively pitiful sounds, which
      were full of animal fright, was hurled at Foma, and louder than all and
      more repulsive than all, Zvantzev&rsquo;s shrill, jarring cry pierced the ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He-e-elp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some one&mdash;in all probability, the sedate gentleman with the side
      whiskers&mdash;roared in his basso:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drowning! They&rsquo;re drowning people!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you people?&rdquo; cried Foma, angrily, irritated by their screams which
      seemed to bite him. And the people ran about on the raft in the madness of
      fright; the raft rocked under their feet, floated faster on account of
      this, and the agitated water was loudly splashing against and under it.
      The screams rent the air, the people jumped about, waving their hands, and
      the stately figure of Sasha alone stood motionless and speechless on the
      edge of the raft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give my regards to the crabs!&rdquo; cried Foma. Foma felt more and more
      cheerful and relieved in proportion as the raft was floating away from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foma Ignatyevich!&rdquo; said Ookhtishchev in a faint, but sober voice, &ldquo;look
      out, this is a dangerous joke. I&rsquo;ll make a complaint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you are drowned? You may complain!&rdquo; answered Foma, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a murderer!&rdquo; exclaimed Zvantzev, sobbing. But at this time a
      ringing splash of water was heard as though it groaned with fright or with
      astonishment. Foma shuddered and became as though petrified. Then rang out
      the wild, deafening shrieks of the women, and the terror-stricken screams
      of men, and all the figures on the raft remained petrified in their
      places. And Foma, staring at the water, felt as though he really were
      petrified. In the water something black, surrounded with splashes, was
      floating toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather instinctively than consciously, Foma threw himself with his chest
      on the beams of the raft, and stretched out his hands, his head hanging
      down over the water. Several incredibly long seconds passed. Cold, wet
      arms clasped his neck and dark eyes flashed before him. Then he understood
      that it was Sasha.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dull horror, which had suddenly seized him, vanished, replaced now by
      wild, rebellious joy. Having dragged the woman out of the water, he
      grasped her by the waist, clasped her to his breast, and, not knowing what
      to say to her, he stared into her eyes with astonishment. She smiled at
      him caressingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am cold,&rdquo; said Sasha, softly, and quivered in every limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma laughed gaily at the sound of her voice, lifted her into his arms and
      quickly, almost running, dashed across the rafts to the shore. She was wet
      and cold, but her breathing was hot, it burned Foma&rsquo;s cheek and filled his
      breast with wild joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to drown me?&rdquo; said she, firmly, pressing close to him. &ldquo;It was
      rather too early. Wait!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How well you have done it,&rdquo; muttered Foma, as he ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine, brave fellow! And your device wasn&rsquo;t bad, either, though
      you seem to be so peaceable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they are still roaring there, ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take them! If they are drowned, we&rsquo;ll be sent to Siberia,&rdquo; said
      the woman, as though she wanted to console and encourage him by this. She
      began to shiver, and the shudder of her body, felt by Foma, made him
      hasten his pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sobs and cries for help followed them from the river. There, on the placid
      water, floated in the twilight a small island, withdrawing from the shore
      toward the stream of the main current of the river, and on that little
      island dark human figures were running about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night was closing down upon them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <p>
      ONE Sunday afternoon, Yakov Tarasovich Mayakin was drinking tea in his
      garden and talking to his daughter. The collar of his shirt unbuttoned, a
      towel wound round his neck, he sat on a bench under a canopy of verdant
      cherry-trees, waved his hands in the air, wiped the perspiration off his
      face, and incessantly poured forth into the air his brisk speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who permits his belly to have the upper hand over him is a fool
      and a rogue! Is there nothing better in the world than eating and
      drinking? Upon what will you pride yourself before people, if you are like
      a hog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s eyes sparkled irritably and angrily, his lips twisted with
      contempt, and the wrinkles of his gloomy face quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Foma were my own son, I would have made a man of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Playing with an acacia branch, Lubov mutely listened to her father&rsquo;s
      words, now and then casting a close and searching look in his agitated,
      quivering face. Growing older, she changed, without noticing it, her
      suspicious and cold relation toward the old man. In his words she now
      began to find the same ideas that were in her books, and this won her over
      on her father&rsquo;s side, involuntarily causing the girl to prefer his live
      words to the cold letters of the book. Always overwhelmed with business
      affairs, always alert and clever, he went his own way alone, and she
      perceived his solitude, knew how painful it was, and her relations toward
      her father grew in warmth. At times she even entered into arguments with
      the old man; he always regarded her remarks contemptuously and
      sarcastically; but more tenderly and attentively from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the deceased Ignat could read in the newspapers of the indecent life
      his son is leading, he would have killed Foma!&rdquo; said Mayakin, striking the
      table with his fists. &ldquo;How they have written it up! It&rsquo;s a disgrace!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He deserves it,&rdquo; said Lubov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say it was done at random! They&rsquo;ve barked at him, as was
      necessary. And who was it that got into such a fit of anger?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What difference does it make to you?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting to know. How cleverly the rascal described Foma&rsquo;s
      behaviour. Evidently he must have been with him and witnessed all the
      indecency himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, he wouldn&rsquo;t go with Foma on a spree!&rsquo; said Lubov, confidently,
      and blushed deeply at her father&rsquo;s searching look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! You have fine acquaintances, Lubka!&rdquo; said Mayakin with humorous
      bitterness. &ldquo;Well, who wrote it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish to know it for, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had no desire to tell, but the old man persisted, and his voice was
      growing more and more dry and angry. Then she asked him uneasily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will not do him any ill for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? I will&mdash;bite his head off! Fool! What can I do to him? They,
      these writers, are not a foolish lot and are therefore a power&mdash;a
      power, the devils! And I am not the governor, and even he cannot put one&rsquo;s
      hand out of joint or tie one&rsquo;s tongue. Like mice, they gnaw us little by
      little. And we have to poison them not with matches, but with roubles.
      Yes! Well, who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember, when I was going to school, a Gymnasium student used to
      come up to us. Yozhov? Such a dark little fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm! Of course, I saw him. I know him. So it&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little mouse! Even at that time one could see already that something
      wrong would come out of him. Even then he stood in the way of other
      people. A bold boy he was. I should have looked after him then. Perhaps, I
      might have made a man of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov looked at her father, smiled inimically, and asked hotly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t he who writes for newspapers a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a long while, the old man did not answer his daughter. Thoughtfully,
      he drummed with his fingers against the table and examined his face, which
      was reflected in the brightly polished brass of the samovar. Then he
      raised his head, winked his eyes and said impressively and irritably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not men, they are sores! The blood of the Russian people has
      become mixed, it has become mixed and spoiled, and from the bad blood have
      come all these book and newspaper-writers, these terrible Pharisees. They
      have broken out everywhere, and they are still breaking out, more and
      more. Whence comes this spoiling of the blood? From slowness of motion.
      Whence the mosquitoes, for instance? From the swamp. All sorts of
      uncleanliness multiply in stagnant waters. The same is true of a
      disordered life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t right, papa!&rdquo; said Lubov, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by&mdash;not right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Writers are the most unselfish people, they are noble personalities! They
      don&rsquo;t want anything&mdash;all they strive for is justice&mdash;truth!
      They&rsquo;re not mosquitoes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov grew excited as she lauded her beloved people; her face was flushed,
      and her eyes looked at her father with so much feeling, as though
      imploring him to believe her, being unable to convince him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you!&rdquo; said the old man, with a sigh, interrupting her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve read
      too much! You&rsquo;ve been poisoned! Tell me&mdash;who are they? No one knows!
      That Yozhov&mdash;what is he? Only God knows. All they want is the truth,
      you say? What modest people they are! And suppose truth is the very
      dearest thing there is? Perhaps everybody is seeking it in silence?
      Believe me&mdash;man cannot be unselfish. Man will not fight for what
      belongs not to him, and if he does fight&mdash;his name is &lsquo;fool,&rsquo; and he
      is of no use to anybody. A man must be able to stand up for himself, for
      his own, then will he attain something! Here you have it! Truth! Here I
      have been reading the same newspaper for almost forty years, and I can see
      well&mdash;here is my face before you, and before me, there on the samovar
      is again my face, but it is another face. You see, these newspapers give a
      samovar face to everything, and do not see the real one. And yet you
      believe them. But I know that my face on the samovar is distorted. No one
      can tell the real truth; man&rsquo;s throat is too delicate for this. And then,
      the real truth is known to nobody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; exclaimed Lubov, sadly, &ldquo;But in books and in newspapers they
      defend the general interests of all the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in what paper is it written that you are weary of life, and that it
      was time for you to get married? So, there your interest is not defended!
      Eh! You! Neither is mine defended. Who knows what I need? Who, but myself,
      understands my interests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, papa, that isn&rsquo;t right, that isn&rsquo;t right! I cannot refute you, but I
      feel that this isn&rsquo;t right!&rdquo; said Lubov almost with despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is right!&rdquo; said the old man, firmly. &ldquo;Russia is confused, and there is
      nothing steadfast in it; everything is staggering! Everybody lives awry,
      everybody walks on one side, there&rsquo;s no harmony in life. All are yelling
      out of tune, in different voices. And not one understands what the other
      is in need of! There is a mist over everything&mdash;everybody inhales
      that mist, and that&rsquo;s why the blood of the people has become spoiled&mdash;hence
      the sores. Man is given great liberty to reason, but is not permitted to
      do anything&mdash;that&rsquo;s why man does not live; but rots and stinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ought one to do, then?&rdquo; asked Lubov, resting her elbows on the table
      and bending toward her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything!&rdquo; cried the old man, passionately. &ldquo;Do everything. Go ahead!
      Let each man do whatever he knows best! But for that liberty must be given
      to man&mdash;complete freedom! Since there has come a time, when everyraw
      youth believes that he knows everything and was created for the complete
      arrangement of life&mdash;give him, give the rogue freedom! Here, Carrion,
      live! Come, come, live! Ah! Then such a comedy will follow; feeling that
      his bridle is off, man will then rush up higher than his ears, and like a
      feather will fly hither and thither. He&rsquo;ll believe himself to be a miracle
      worker, and then he&rsquo;ll start to show his spirit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man paused awhile and, lowering his voice, went on, with a
      malicious smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is very little of that creative spirit in him! He&rsquo;ll bristle up
      for a day or two, stretch himself on all sides&mdash;and the poor fellow
      will soon grow weak. For his heart is rotten&mdash;he, he, he! Here, he,
      he, he! The dear fellow will be caught by the real, worthy people, by
      those real people who are competent to be the actual civil masters, who
      will manage life not with a rod nor with a pen, but with a finger and with
      brains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, they will say. Have you grown tired, gentlemen? What, they will
      say, your spleens cannot stand a real fire, can they? So&mdash;&rdquo; and,
      raising his voice, the old man concluded his speech in an authoritative
      tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, now, you rabble, hold your tongues, and don&rsquo;t squeak! Or
      we&rsquo;ll shake you off the earth, like worms from a tree! Silence, dear
      fellows! Ha, ha, ha! That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s going to happen, Lubavka! He, he,
      he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man was in a merry mood. His wrinkles quivered, and carried away
      by his words, he trembled, closed his eyes now and then, and smacked his
      lips as though tasting his own wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then those who will take the upper hand in the confusion will arrange
      life wisely, after their own fashion. Then things won&rsquo;t go at random, but
      as if by rote. It&rsquo;s a pity that we shall not live to see it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s words fell one after another upon Lubov like meshes of a big
      strong net&mdash;they fell and enmeshed her, and the girl, unable to free
      herself from them, maintained silence, dizzied by her father&rsquo;s words.
      Staring into his face with an intense look, she sought support for herself
      in his words and heard in them something similar to what she had read in
      books, and which seemed to her the real truth. But the malignant,
      triumphant laughter of her father stung her heart, and the wrinkles, which
      seemed to creep about on his face like so many dark little snakes,
      inspired her with a certain fear for herself in his presence. She felt
      that he was turning her aside from what had seemed so simple and so easy
      in her dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; she suddenly asked the old man, in obedience to a thought and a
      desire that unexpectedly flashed through her mind. &ldquo;Papa! and what sort of
      a man&mdash;what in your opinion is Taras?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin shuddered. His eyebrows began to move angrily, he fixed his keen,
      small eyes on his daughter&rsquo;s face and asked her drily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of talk is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must he not even be mentioned?&rdquo; said Lubov, softly and confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don&rsquo;t want to speak of him&mdash;and I also advise you not to speak of
      him! &ldquo;&mdash;the old man threatened her with his finger and lowered his
      head with a gloomy frown. But when he said that he did not want to speak
      of his son, he evidently did not understand himself correctly, for after a
      minute&rsquo;s silence he said sternly and angrily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taraska, too, is a sore. Life is breathing upon you, milksops, and you
      cannot discriminate its genuine scents, and you swallow all sorts of
      filth, wherefore there is trouble in your heads. That&rsquo;s why you are not
      competent to do anything, and you are unhappy because of this
      incompetence. Taraska. Yes. He must be about forty now. He is lost to me!
      A galley-slave&mdash;is that my son? A blunt-snouted young pig. He would
      not speak to his father, and&mdash;he stumbled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he do?&rdquo; asked Lubov, eagerly listening to the old man&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows? It may be that now he cannot understand himself, if he became
      sensible, and he must have become a sensible man; he&rsquo;s the son of a father
      who&rsquo;s not stupid, and then he must have suffered not a little. They coddle
      them, the nihilists! They should have turned them over to me. I&rsquo;d show
      them what to do. Into the desert! Into the isolated places&mdash;march!
      Come, now, my wise fellows, arrange life there according to your own will!
      Go ahead! And as authorities over them I&rsquo;d station the robust peasants.
      Well, now, honourable gentlemen, you were given to eat and to drink, you
      were given an education&mdash;what have you learned? Pay your debts, pray.
      Yes, I would not spend a broken grosh on them. I would squeeze all the
      price out of them&mdash;give it up! You must not set a man at naught. It
      is not enough to imprison him! You transgressed the law, and are a
      gentleman? Never mind, you must work. Out of a single seed comes an ear of
      corn, and a man ought not be permitted to perish without being of use! An
      economical carpenter finds a place for each and every chip of wood&mdash;just
      so must every man be profitably used up, and used up entire, to the very
      last vein. All sorts of trash have a place in life, and man is never
      trash. Eh! it is bad when power lives without reason, nor is it good when
      reason lives without power. Take Foma now. Who is coming there&mdash;give
      a look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning around, Lubov noticed the captain of the &ldquo;Yermak,&rdquo; Yefim, coming
      along the garden path. He had respectfully removed his cap and bowed to
      her. There was a hopelessly guilty expression on his face and he seemed
      abashed. Yakov Tarasovich recognized him and, instantly grown alarmed, he
      cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you coming from? What has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I have come to you!&rdquo; said Yefim, stopping short at the table,
      with a low bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I see, you&rsquo;ve come to me. What&rsquo;s the matter? Where&rsquo;s the steamer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The steamer is there!&rdquo; Yefim thrust his hand somewhere into the air and
      heavily shifted from one foot to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it, devil? Speak coherently&mdash;what has happened?&rdquo; cried the
      old man, enraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&mdash;a misfortune, Yakov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been wrecked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, God saved us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burned up? Well, speak more quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yefim drew air into his chest and said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barge No. 9 was sunk&mdash;smashed up. One man&rsquo;s back was broken, and one
      is altogether missing, so that he must have drowned. About five more were
      injured, but not so very badly, though some were disabled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So-o!&rdquo; drawled out Mayakin, measuring the captain with an ill-omened
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Yefimushka, I&rsquo;ll strip your skin off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t I who did it!&rdquo; said Yefim, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not you?&rdquo; cried the old man, shaking with rage. &ldquo;Who then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The master himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foma? And you. Where were you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was lying in the hatchway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You were lying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was bound there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha-at?&rdquo; screamed the old man in a shrill voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to tell you everything as it happened. He was drunk and he
      shouted: &ldquo;&lsquo;Get away! I&rsquo;ll take command myself!&rsquo; I said &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t! I am the
      captain.&rsquo; &lsquo;Bind him!&rsquo; said he. And when they had bound me, they lowered me
      into the hatchway, with the sailors. And as the master was drunk, he
      wanted to have some fun. A fleet of boats was coming toward us. Six empty
      barges towed by &lsquo;Cheruigorez.&rsquo; So Foma Ignatyich blocked their way. They
      whistled. More than once. I must tell the truth&mdash;they whistled!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and they couldn&rsquo;t manage it&mdash;the two barges in front crashed
      into us. And as they struck the side of our ninth, we were smashed to
      pieces. And the two barges were also smashed. But we fared much worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin rose from the chair and burst into jarring, angry laughter. And
      Yefim sighed, and, outstretching his hands, said: &ldquo;He has a very violent
      character. When he is sober he is silent most of the time, and walks
      around thoughtfully, but when he wets his springs with wine&mdash;then he
      breaks loose. Then he is not master of himself and of his business&mdash;but
      their wild enemy&mdash;you must excuse me! And I want to leave, Yakov
      Tarasovich! I am not used to being without a master, I cannot live without
      a master!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet!&rdquo; said Mayakin, sternly. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Foma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There; at the same place. Immediately after the accident, he came to
      himself and at once sent for workmen. They&rsquo;ll lift the barge. They may
      have started by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he there alone?&rdquo; asked Mayakin, lowering his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; replied Yefim, softly, glancing stealthily at Lubov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady with him. A dark one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks as though the woman is out of her wits,&rdquo; said Yefim, with a
      sigh. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s forever singing. She sings very well. It&rsquo;s very captivating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not asking you about her!&rdquo; cried Mayakin, angrily. The wrinkles of
      his face were painfully quivering, and it seemed to Lubov that her father
      was about to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm yourself, papa!&rdquo; she entreated caressingly. &ldquo;Maybe the loss isn&rsquo;t so
      great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not great?&rdquo; cried Yakov Tarasovich in a ringing voice. &ldquo;What do you
      understand, you fool? Is it only that the barge was smashed? Eh, you! A
      man is lost! That&rsquo;s what it is! And he is essential to me! I need him,
      dull devils that you are!&rdquo; The old man shook his head angrily and with
      brisk steps walked off along the garden path leading toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Foma was at this time about four hundred versts away from his
      godfather, in a village hut, on the shore of the Volga. He had just
      awakened from sleep, and lying on the floor, on a bed of fresh hay, in the
      middle of the hut, he gazed gloomily out of the window at the sky, which
      was covered with gray, scattered clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was tearing them asunder and driving them somewhere; heavy and
      weary, one overtaking another, they were passing across the sky in an
      enormous flock. Now forming a solid mass, now breaking into fragments, now
      falling low over the earth, in silent confusion, now again rising upward,
      one swallowed by another.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Without moving his head, which was heavy from intoxication, Foma looked
long at the clouds and finally began to feel as though silent clouds
were also passing through his breast,&mdash;passing, breathing a damp
coldness upon his heart and oppressing him. There was something impotent
in the motion of the clouds across the sky. And he felt the same within
him. Without thinking, he pictured to himself all he had gone through
during the past months. It seemed to him as though he had fallen into a
turbid, boiling stream, and now he had been seized by dark waves, that
resembled these clouds in the sky; had been seized and carried away
somewhere, even as the clouds were carried by the wind. In the darkness
and the tumult which surrounded him, he saw as though through a mist
that certain other people were hastening together with him&mdash;to-day not
those of yesterday, new ones each day, yet all looking alike&mdash;equally
pitiful and repulsive. Intoxicated, noisy, greedy, they flew about
him as in a whirlwind, caroused at his expense, abused him, fought,
screamed, and even wept more than once. And he beat them. He remembered
that one day he had struck somebody on the face, torn someone&rsquo;s coat off
and thrown it into the water and that some one had kissed his hands with
wet, cold lips as disgusting as frogs. Had kissed and wept, imploring
him not to kill. Certain faces flashed through his memory, certain
sounds and words rang in it. A woman in a yellow silk waist, unfastened
at the breast, had sung in a loud, sobbing voice:

     &ldquo;And so let us live while we can
     And then&mdash;e&rsquo;en grass may cease to grow.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      All these people, like himself, grown wild and beastlike, were seized by
      the same dark wave and carried away like rubbish. All these people, like
      himself, must have been afraid to look forward to see whither this
      powerful, wild wave was carrying them. And drowning their fear in wine,
      they were rushing forward down the current struggling, shouting, doing
      something absurd, playing the fool, clamouring, clamouring, without ever
      being cheerful. He was doing the same, whirling in their midst. And now it
      seemed to him, that he was doing all this for fear of himself, in order to
      pass the sooner this strip of life, or in order not to think of what would
      be afterward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the burning turmoil of carouses, in the crowd of people, seized by
      debauchery, perplexed by violent passions, half-crazy in their longing to
      forget themselves&mdash;only Sasha was calm and contained. She never drank
      to intoxication, always addressed people in a firm, authoritative voice,
      and all her movements were equally confident, as though this stream had
      not taken possession of her, but she was herself mastering its violent
      course. She seemed to Foma the cleverest person of all those that
      surrounded him, and the most eager for noise and carouse; she held them
      all in her sway, forever inventing something new and speaking in one and
      the same manner to everybody; for the driver, the lackey and the sailor
      she had the same tone and the same words as for her friends and for Foma.
      She was younger and prettier than Pelageya, but her caresses were silent,
      cold. Foma imagined that deep in her heart she was concealing from
      everybody something terrible, that she would never love anyone, never
      reveal herself entire. This secrecy in the woman attracted him toward her
      with a feeling of timorous curiosity, of a great, strained interest in her
      calm, cold soul, which seemed even as dark as her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow Foma said to her one day:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what piles of money you and I have squandered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should we save it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, why?&rdquo; thought Foma, astonished by the fact that she reasoned so
      simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked her at another occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, have you forgotten my name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you wish to know then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am asking you about your origin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I am a native of the province of Yaroslavl. I&rsquo;m from Ooglich. I was a
      harpist. Well, shall I taste sweeter to you, now that you know who I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know it?&rdquo; asked Foma, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that enough for you? I shall tell you nothing more about it. What
      for? We all come from the same place, both people and beasts. And what is
      there that I can tell you about myself? And what for? All this talk is
      nonsense. Let&rsquo;s rather think a little as to how we shall pass the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On that day they took a trip on a steamer, with an orchestra of music,
      drank champagne, and every one of them got terribly drunk. Sasha sang a
      peculiar, wonderfully sad song, and Foma, moved by her singing, wept like
      a child. Then he danced with her the &ldquo;Russian dance,&rdquo; and finally,
      perspiring and fatigued, threw himself overboard in his clothes and was
      nearly drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, recalling all this and a great deal more, he felt ashamed of himself
      and dissatisfied with Sasha. He looked at her well-shaped figure, heard
      her even breathing and felt that he did not love this woman, and that she
      was unnecessary to him. Certain gray, oppressive thoughts were slowly
      springing up in his heavy, aching head. It seemed to him as though
      everything he had lived through during this time was twisted within him
      into a heavy and moist ball, and that now this ball was rolling about in
      his breast, unwinding itself slowly, and the thin gray cords were binding
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is going on in me?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve begun to carouse. Why? I don&rsquo;t
      know how to live. I don&rsquo;t understand myself. Who am I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was astonished by this question, and he paused over it, attempting to
      make it clear to himself&mdash;why he was unable to live as firmly and
      confidently as other people do. He was now still more tortured. by
      conscience. More uneasy at this thought, he tossed about on the hay and
      irritated, pushed Sasha with his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; said she, although nearly asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. You&rsquo;re not such a lady of quality!&rdquo; muttered Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her back to him, and said lazily, with a lazy yawn:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dreamed that I became a harpist again. It seemed to me that I was
      singing a solo, and opposite me stood a big, dirty dog, snarling and
      waiting for me to finish the song. And I was afraid of the dog. And I knew
      that it would devour me, as soon as I stopped singing. So I kept singing,
      singing. And suddenly it seemed my voice failed me. Horrible! And the dog
      is gnashing his teeth. Oh Lord, have mercy on me! What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop your idle talk!&rdquo; Foma interrupted her sternly. &ldquo;You better tell me
      what you know about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, for instance, that you are awake now,&rdquo; she answered, without
      turning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Awake? That&rsquo;s true. I&rsquo;ve awakened,&rdquo; said Foma, thoughtfully and, throwing
      his arm behind his head, went on: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I am asking you. What sort
      of man do you think I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man with a drunken headache,&rdquo; answered Sasha, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aleksandra!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, beseechingly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t talk nonsense! Tell me
      conscientiously, what do you think of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anything!&rdquo; she said drily. &ldquo;Why are you bothering me with
      nonsense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this nonsense?&rdquo; said Foma, sadly. &ldquo;Eh, you devils! This is the
      principal thing. The most essential thing to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heaved a deep sigh and became silent. After a minute&rsquo;s silence, Sasha
      began to speak in her usual, indifferent voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him who he is, and why he is such as he is? Did you ever see! Is it
      proper to ask such questions of our kind of women? And on what ground
      should I think about each and every man? I have not even time to think
      about myself, and, perhaps, I don&rsquo;t feel like doing it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma laughed drily and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were like this&mdash;and had no desires for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the woman raised her head from the pillow, looked into Foma&rsquo;s face
      and lay down again, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are musing too much. Look out&mdash;no good will come of it to you. I
      cannot tell you anything about yourself. It is impossible to say anything
      true about a man. Who can understand him? Man does not know himself. Well,
      here, I&rsquo;ll tell you&mdash;you are better than others. But what of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in what way am I better?&rdquo; asked Foma, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! When one sings a good song&mdash;you weep. When one does some mean
      thing&mdash;you beat him. With women you are simple, you are not impudent
      to them. You are peaceable. And you can also be daring, sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet all this did not satisfy Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not telling me the right thing!&rdquo; said he, softly. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t
      know what you want. But see here, what are we going to do after they have
      raised the barge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can we do?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go to Nizhni or to Kazan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To carouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to carouse any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else are you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And both were silent for a long time, without looking at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a disagreeable character,&rdquo; said Sasha, &ldquo;a wearisome character.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But nevertheless I won&rsquo;t get drunk any more!&rdquo; said Foma, firmly and
      confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are lying!&rdquo; retorted Sasha, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see! What do you think&mdash;is it good to lead such a life as
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, just tell me&mdash;is it good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma looked at her askance and, irritated, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What repulsive words you speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here again I haven&rsquo;t pleased him!&rdquo; said Sasha, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fine crowd!&rdquo; said Foma, painfully wrinkling his face. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
      like trees. They also live, but how? No one understands. They are crawling
      somewhere. And can give no account either to themselves or to others. When
      the cockroach crawls, he knows whither and wherefore he wants to go? And
      you? Whither are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; Sasha interrupted him, and asked him calmly: &ldquo;What have you to
      do with me? You may take from me all that you want, but don&rsquo;t you creep
      into my soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into your so-o-ul!&rdquo; Foma drawled out, with contempt. &ldquo;Into what soul? He,
      he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to pace the room, gathering together the clothes that were
      scattered everywhere. Foma watched her and was displeased because she did
      not get angry at him for his words about her soul. Her face looked calm
      and indifferent, as usual, but he wished to see her angry or offended; he
      wished for something human from the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soul!&rdquo; he exclaimed, persisting in his aim. &ldquo;Can one who has a soul
      live as you live? A soul has fire burning in it, there is a sense of shame
      in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time she was sitting on a bench, putting on her stockings, but at
      his words she raised her head and sternly fixed her eyes upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you staring at?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you speak that way?&rdquo; said she, without lifting her eyes from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out&mdash;must you really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was something threatening in her question. Foma felt intimidated and
      said, this time without provocation in his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I help speaking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you!&rdquo; sighed Sasha and resumed dressing herself
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merely so. You seem as though you were born of two fathers. Do you know
      what I have observed among people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a man cannot answer for himself, it means that he is afraid of
      himself, that his price is a grosh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you refer to me?&rdquo; asked Foma, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To you, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw a pink morning gown over her shoulders and, standing in the
      centre of the room, stretched out her hand toward Foma, who lay at her
      feet, and said to him in a low, dull voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no right to speak about my soul. You have nothing to do with it!
      And therefore hold your tongue! I may speak! If I please, I could tell
      something to all of you. Eh, how I could tell it! Only,&mdash;who will
      dare to listen to me, if I should speak at the top of my voice? And I have
      some words about you,&mdash;they&rsquo;re like hammers! And I could knock you
      all on your heads so that you would lose your wits. And although you are
      all rascals&mdash;you cannot be cured by words. You should be burned in
      the fire&mdash;just as frying-pans are burned out on the first Monday of
      Lent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Raising her hands she abruptly loosened her hair, and when it fell over
      her shoulders in heavy, black locks&mdash;the woman shook her head
      haughtily and said, with contempt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that I am leading a loose life! It often happens, that the man
      who lives in filth is purer than he who goes about in silks. If you only
      knew what I think of you, you dogs, what wrath I bear against you! And
      because of this wrath&mdash;I am silent! For I fear that if I should sing
      it to you&mdash;my soul would become empty. I would have nothing to live
      on.&rdquo; Foma looked at her, and now he was pleased with her. In her words
      there was something akin to his frame of mind. Laughing, he said to her,
      with satisfaction on his face and in his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also feel that something is growing within my soul. Eh, I too shall
      have my say, when the time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against whom?&rdquo; asked Sasha, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;against everybody!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, jumping to his feet. &ldquo;Against
      falsehood. I shall ask&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask whether the samovar is ready,&rdquo; Sasha ordered indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma glanced at her and cried, enraged:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the devil! Ask yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right, I shall. What are you snarling about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she stepped out of the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      In piercing gusts the wind blew across the river, striking against its
      bosom, and covered with troubled dark waves, the river was spasmodically
      rushing toward the wind with a noisy splash, and all in the froth of
      wrath. The willow bushes on the shore bent low to the ground&mdash;trembling,
      they now were about to lie down on the ground, now, frightened, they
      thrust themselves away from it, driven by the blows of the wind. In the
      air rang a whistling, a howling, and a deep groaning sound, that burst
      from dozens of human breasts:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It goes&mdash;it goes&mdash;it goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This exclamation, abrupt as a blow, and heavy as the breath from an
      enormous breast, which is suffocating from exertion, was soaring over the
      river, falling upon the waves, as if encouraging their mad play with the
      wind, and they struck the shores with might.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two empty barges lay anchored by the mountainous shore, and their tall
      masts, rising skyward, rocked in commotion from side to side, as though
      describing some invisible pattern in the air. The decks of both barges
      were encumbered with scaffolds, built of thick brown beams; huge sheaves
      were hanging everywhere; chains and ropes were fastened to them, and
      rocking in the air; the links of the chains were faintly clanging. A
      throng of peasants in blue and in red blouses pulled a large beam across
      the dock and, heavily stamping their feet, groaned with full chest:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It goes&mdash;it goes&mdash;it goes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here and there human figures clung to the scaffoldings, like big lumps of
      blue and red; the wind, blowing their blouses and their trousers, gave the
      men odd forms, making them appear now hump-backed, now round and puffed up
      like bladders. The people on the scaffolds and on the decks of the barges
      were making fast, hewing, sawing, driving in nails; and big arms, with
      shirt sleeves rolled up to the elbows were seen everywhere. The wind
      scattered splinters of wood, and a varied, lively, brisk noise in the air;
      the saw gnawed the wood, choking with wicked joy; the beams, wounded by
      the axes, moaned and groaned drily; the boards cracked sickly as they
      split from the blows they received; the jointer squeaked maliciously. The
      iron clinking of the chains and the groaning creaking of the sheaves
      joined the wrathful roaring of the waves, and the wind howled loudly,
      scattering over the river the noise of toil and drove the clouds across
      the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mishka-a! The deuce take you!&rdquo; cried someone from the top of the
      scaffolding. And from the deck, a large-formed peasant, with his head
      thrown upward, answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wh-a-at?&rdquo; And the wind, playing with his long, flaxen beard, flung it
      into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hand us the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A resounding basso shouted as through a speaking-trumpet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how you&rsquo;ve fastened this board, you blind devil? Can&rsquo;t you see? I&rsquo;ll
      rub your eyes for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull, my boys, come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once more&mdash;brave&mdash;boys!&rdquo; cried out some one in a loud,
      beseeching voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Handsome and stately, in a short cloth jacket and high boots, Foma stood,
      leaning his back against a mast, and stroking his beard with his trembling
      hand, admired the daring work of the peasants. The noise about him called
      forth in him a persistent desire to shout, to work together with the
      peasants, to hew wood, to carry burdens, to command&mdash;to compel
      everybody to pay attention to him, and to show them his strength, his
      skill, and the live soul within him. But he restrained himself. And
      standing speechless, motionless, he felt ashamed and afraid of something.
      He was embarrassed by the fact that he was master over everybody there,
      and that if he were to start to work himself, no one would believe that he
      was working merely to satisfy his desire, and not to spur them on in their
      work; to set them an example. And then, the peasants might laugh at him,
      in all probability.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fair and curly-headed fellow, with his shirt collar unbuttoned, was now
      and again running past him, now carrying a log on his shoulder, now an axe
      in his hands; he was skipping along, like a frolicsome goat, scattering
      about him cheerful, ringing laughter, jests, violent oaths, and working
      unceasingly, now assisting one, now another, as he was cleverly and
      quickly running across the deck, which was obstructed with timber and
      shavings. Foma watched him closely, and envied this merry fellow, who was
      radiant with something healthy and inspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently he is happy,&rdquo; thought Foma, and this thought provoked in him a
      keen, piercing desire to insult him somehow, to embarrass him. All those
      about him were seized with the zest of pressing work, all were unanimously
      and hastily fastening the scaffoldings, arranging the pulleys, preparing
      to raise the sunken barge from the bottom of the river; all were sound and
      merry&mdash;they all lived. While he stood alone, aside from them, not
      knowing what to do, not knowing how to do anything, feeling himself
      superfluous to this great toil. It vexed him to feel that he was
      superfluous among men, and the more closely he watched them, the more
      intense was this vexation. And he was stung most by the thought that all
      this was being done for him. And yet he was out of place there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is my place, then?&rdquo; he thought gloomily. &ldquo;Where is my work? Am I,
      then, some deformed being? I have just as much strength as any of them.
      But of what use is it to me?&rdquo; The chains clanged, the pulleys groaned, the
      blows of the axes resounded loud over the river, and the barges rocked
      from the shocks of the waves, but to Foma it seemed that he was rocking
      not because the barge was rocking under his feet, but rather because he
      was not able to stand firmly anywhere, he was not destined to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contractor, a small-sized peasant with a small pointed gray beard, and
      with narrow little eyes on his gray wrinkled face, came up to him and
      said, not loud, but pronouncing his words with a certain tone from the
      bottom of the river. He wished that they might not succeed, that they
      might feel embarrassed in his presence, and a wicked thought flashed
      through his mind:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps the chains will break.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys! Attention!&rdquo; shouted the contractor. &ldquo;Start all together. God bless
      us!&rdquo; And suddenly, clasping his hands in the air, he cried in a shrill
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&mdash;her&mdash;go-o-o!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The labourers took up his shout, and all cried out in one voice, with
      excitement and exertion:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her go! She moves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pulleys squeaked and creaked, the chains clanked, strained under the
      heavy weight that suddenly fell upon them; and the labourers, bracing
      their chests against the handle of the windlasses, roared and tramped
      heavily. The waves splashed noisily between the barges as though unwilling
      to give up their prize to the men. Everywhere about Foma, chains and ropes
      were stretched and they quivered from the strain&mdash;they were creeping
      somewhere across the deck, past his feet, like huge gray worms; they were
      lifted upward, link after link, falling back with a rattling noise, and
      all these sounds were drowned by the deafening roaring of the labourers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It goes, it goes, it goes,&rdquo; they all sang in unison, triumphantly. But
      the ringing voice of the contractor pierced the deep wave of their voices,
      and cut it even as a knife cuts bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boys! Go ahead, all at once, all at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma was seized with a strange emotion; passionately he now longed to
      mingle with this excited roaring of the labourers, which was as broad and
      as powerful as the river&mdash;to blend with this irritating, creaking,
      squeaking, clanging of iron and turbulent splashing of waves. Perspiration
      came out on his face from the intensity of his desire, and suddenly pale
      from agitation, he tore himself away from the mast, and rushed toward the
      windlasses with big strides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All at once! At once!&rdquo; he cried in a fierce voice. When he reached the
      lever of the windlass, he dashed his chest against it with all his might,
      and not feeling the pain, he began to go around the windlass, roaring, and
      firmly stamping his feet against the deck. Something powerful and burning
      rushed into his breast, replacing the efforts which he spent while turning
      the windlass-lever! Inexpressible joy raged within him and forced itself
      outside in an agitated cry. It seemed to him that he alone, that only his
      strength was turning the lever, thus raising the weight, and that his
      strength was growing and growing. Stooping, and lowering his head, like a
      bull he massed the power of the weight, which threw him back, but yielded
      to him, nevertheless. Each step forward excited him the more, each
      expended effort was immediately replaced in him by a flood of burning and
      vehement pride. His head reeled, his eyes were blood-shot, he saw nothing,
      he only felt that they were yielding to him, that he would soon conquer,
      that he would overthrow with his strength something huge which obstructed
      his way&mdash;would overthrow, conquer and then breathe easily and freely,
      full of proud delight. For the first time in his life he experienced such
      a powerful, spiritualizing sensation, and he drank it with all the
      strength of a hungry, thirsty soul; he was intoxicated by it and he gave
      vent to his joy in loud, exulting cries in unison with the workers:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It goes&mdash;it goes&mdash;it goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on! Fasten! Hold on, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something dashed against Foma&rsquo;s chest, and he was hurled backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you on a successful result, Foma Ignatyich!&rdquo; the
      contractor congratulated him and the wrinkles quivered on his face in
      cheerful beams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God! You must be quite tired now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cold wind blew in Foma&rsquo;s face. A contented, boastful bustle was in the air
      about him; swearing at one another in a friendly way, merry, with smiles
      on their perspiring brows, the peasants approached him and surrounded him
      closely. He smiled in embarrassment: the excitement within him had not yet
      calmed down and this hindered him from understanding what had happened and
      why all those who surrounded him were so merry and contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve raised a hundred and seventy thousand puds as if we plucked a
      radish from a garden-bed!&rdquo; said some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to get a vedro of whisky from our master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma, standing on a heap of cable, looked over the heads of the workers
      and saw; between the barges, side by side with them, stood a third barge,
      black, slippery, damaged, wrapped in chains. It was warped all over, it
      seemed as though it swelled from some terrible disease and, impotent,
      clumsy, it was suspended between its companions, leaning against them. Its
      broken mast stood out mournfully in the centre; reddish streams of water,
      like blood, were running across the deck, which was covered with stains of
      rust. Everywhere on the deck lay heaps of iron, of black, wet stumps of
      wood, and of ropes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raised?&rdquo; asked Foma, not knowing what to say at the sight of this ugly,
      heavy mass, and again feeling offended at the thought that merely for the
      sake of raising this dirty, bruised monster from the water, his soul had
      foamed up with such joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the barge?&rdquo; asked Foma, indefinitely, addressing the contractor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty good! We must unload right away, and put a company of about
      twenty carpenters to work on it&mdash;they&rsquo;ll bring it quickly into
      shape,&rdquo; said the contractor in a consoling tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the light-haired fellow, gaily and broadly smiling into Foma&rsquo;s face,
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we going to have any vodka?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you wait? You have time!&rdquo; said the contractor, sternly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      see&mdash;the man is tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the peasants began to speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, he is tired!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t easy work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, one gets tired if he isn&rsquo;t used to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is even hard to eat gruel if you are not used to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not tired,&rdquo; said Foma, gloomily, and again were heard the respectful
      exclamations of the peasants, as they surrounded him more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work, if one likes it, is a pleasant thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like playing with a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the light-haired fellow persisted in his request:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Honour! You ought to treat us to a vedro of vodka, eh?&rdquo; he said,
      smiling and sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma looked at the bearded faces before him and felt like saying something
      offensive to them. But somehow everything became confused in his brain, he
      found no thoughts in it and, finally, without giving himself an account of
      his words, said angrily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you want is to drink all the time! It makes no difference to you what
      you do! You should have thought&mdash;why? to what purpose? Eh, you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an expression of perplexity on the faces of those that
      surrounded him, blue and red, bearded figures began to sigh, scratch
      themselves, shift themselves from one foot to another. Others cast a
      hopeless glance at Foma and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; said the contractor, with a sigh. &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t harm! That is&mdash;to
      think&mdash;why and how. These are words of wisdom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light-haired fellow had a different opinion on the matter; smiling
      kind-heartedly, he waved his hand and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have to think over our work! If we have it&mdash;we do it! Our
      business is simple! When a rouble is earned&mdash;thank God! we can do
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know what&rsquo;s necessary to do?&rdquo; questioned Foma, irritated by
      the contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is necessary&mdash;this and that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where&rsquo;s the sense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s but one and the same sense in everything for our class&mdash;when
      you have earned for bread and taxes&mdash;live! And when there&rsquo;s something
      to drink, into the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, with contempt. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re also talking! What do
      you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it our business to understand?&rdquo; said the light-haired fellow, with a
      nod of the head. It now bored him to speak to Foma. He suspected that he
      was unwilling to treat them to vodka and he was somewhat angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said Foma, instructively, pleased that the fellow yielded to
      him, and not noticing the cross, sarcastic glances. &ldquo;And he who
      understands feels that it is necessary to do everlasting work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, for God!&rdquo; explained the contractor, eyeing the peasants, and
      added, with a devout sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. Oh, how true that is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Foma was inspired with the desire to say something correct and
      important, after which these people might regard him in a different light,
      for he was displeased with the fact that all, save the light-haired
      fellow, kept silent and looked at him askance, surlily, with such weary,
      gloomy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is necessary to do such work,&rdquo; he said, moving his eyebrows. &ldquo;Such
      work that people may say a thousand years hence: &lsquo;This was done by the
      peasants of Bogorodsk&mdash;yes!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light-haired fellow glanced at Foma with astonishment and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we, perhaps, to drink the Volga dry?&rdquo; Then he sniffed and, nodding
      his head, announced: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that&mdash;we should all burst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma became confused at his words and looked about him; the peasants were
      smiling morosely, disdainfully, sarcastically. And these smiles stung him
      like needles. A serious-looking peasant, with a big gray beard, who had
      not yet opened his mouth up to that time, suddenly opened it now, came
      closer to Foma and said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even if we were to drink the Volga dry, and eat up that mountain,
      into the bargain&mdash;that too would be forgotten, your Honour.
      Everything will be forgotten. Life is long. It is not for us to do such
      deeds as would stand out above everything else. But we can put up
      scaffoldings&mdash;that we can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke and sceptically spitting at his feet, indifferently walked off
      from Foma, and slipped into the crowd, as a wedge into a tree. His words
      crushed Foma completely; he felt, that the peasants considered him stupid
      and ridiculous. And in order to save his importance as master in their
      eyes, to attract again the now exhausted attention of the peasants to
      himself, he bristled up, comically puffed up his cheeks and blurted out in
      an impressive voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make you a present of three buckets of vodka.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brief speeches have always the most meaning and are always apt to produce
      a strong impression. The peasants respectfully made way for Foma, making
      low bows to him, and, smiling merrily and gratefully, thanked him for his
      generosity in a unanimous roar of approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me over to the shore,&rdquo; said Foma, feeling that the excitement that
      had just been aroused in him would not last long. A worm was gnawing his
      heart, and he was weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel disgusted!&rdquo; he said, entering the hut where Sasha, in a smart,
      pink gown, was bustling about the table, arranging wines and refreshments.
      &ldquo;I feel disgusted, Aleksandra! If you could only do something with me,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him attentively and, seating herself on the bench, shoulder
      to shoulder with him, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since you feel disgusted&mdash;it means that you want something. What is
      it you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; replied Foma, nodding his head mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it&mdash;search.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am unable to think. Nothing comes out of my thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you, my child!&rdquo; said Sasha, softly and disdainfully, moving away from
      him. &ldquo;Your head is superfluous to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma neither caught her tone nor noticed her movement. Leaning his hands
      against the bench, he bent forward, looked at the floor, and, swaying his
      body to and fro, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I think and think&mdash;and the whole soul is stuck round with
      thoughts as with tar. And suddenly everything disappears, without leaving
      any trace. Then it is dark in the soul as in a cellar&mdash;dark, damp and
      empty&mdash;there is nothing at all in it! It is even terrible&mdash;I
      feel then as though I were not a man, but a bottomless ravine. You ask me
      what I want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sasha looked at him askance and pensively began to sing softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, when the wind blows&mdash;mist comes from the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to carouse&mdash;it is repulsive! Always the same&mdash;the
      people, the amusements, the wine. When I grow malicious&mdash;I&rsquo;d thrash
      everybody. I am not pleased with men&mdash;what are they? It is impossible
      to understand them&mdash;why do they keep on living? And when they speak
      the truth&mdash;to whom are we to listen? One says this, another that.
      While I&mdash;I cannot say anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Eh, without thee, dear, my life is weary,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      sang Sasha, staring at the wall before her. And Foma kept on rocking and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are times when I feel guilty before men. Everybody lives, makes
      noise, while I am frightened, staggered&mdash;as if I did not feel the
      earth under me. Was it, perhaps, my mother that endowed me with apathy? My
      godfather says that she was as cold as ice&mdash;that she was forever
      yearning towards something. I am also yearning. Toward men I am yearning.
      I&rsquo;d like to go to them and say: &lsquo;Brethren, help me! Teach me! I know not
      how to live!. And if I am guilty&mdash;forgive me!&rsquo; But looking about, I
      see there&rsquo;s no one to speak to. No one wants it&mdash;they are all
      rascals! And it seems they are even worse than I am. For I am, at least,
      ashamed of living as I am, while they are not! They go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma uttered some violent, unbecoming invectives and became silent. Sasha
      broke off her song and moved still farther away from him. The wind was
      raging outside the window, hurling dust against the window-panes.
      Cockroaches were rustling on the oven as they crawled over a bunch of pine
      wood splinters. Somewhere in the yard a calf was lowing pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sasha glanced at Foma, with a sarcastic smile, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s another unfortunate creature lowing. You ought to go to him;
      perhaps you could sing in unison. And placing her hand on his curly head
      she jestingly pushed it on the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are people like yourself good for? That&rsquo;s what you ought to think
      of. What are you groaning about? You are disgusted with being idle&mdash;occupy
      yourself, then, with business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord!&rdquo; Foma nodded his head. &ldquo;It is hard for one to make himself
      understood. Yes, it is hard!&rdquo; And irritated, he almost cried out: &ldquo;What
      business? I have no yearning toward business! What is business? Business
      is merely a name&mdash;and if you should look into the depth, into the
      root of it&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find it is nothing but absurdity! Do I not
      understand it? I understand everything, I see everything, I feel
      everything! Only my tongue is dumb. What aim is there in business? Money?
      I have plenty of it! I could choke you to death with it, cover you with
      it. All this business is nothing but fraud. I meet business people&mdash;well,
      and what about them? Their greediness is immense, and yet they purposely
      whirl about in business that they might not see themselves. They hide
      themselves, the devils. Try to free them from this bustle&mdash;what will
      happen? Like blind men they will grope about hither and thither; they&rsquo;ll
      lose their mind&mdash;they&rsquo;ll go mad! I know it! Do you think that
      business brings happiness into man? No, that&rsquo;s not so&mdash;something else
      is missing here. This is not everything yet! The river flows that men may
      sail on it; the tree grows&mdash;to be useful; the dog&mdash;to guard the
      house. There is justification for everything in the world! And men, like
      cockroaches, are altogether superfluous on earth. Everything is for them,
      and they&mdash;what are they for? Aha! Wherein is their justification? Ha,
      ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma was triumphant. It seemed to him that he had found something good for
      himself, something severe against men. And feeling that, because of this,
      there was great joy in him, he laughed loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does not your head ache?&rdquo; inquired Sasha, anxiously, scrutinizing his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul aches!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, passionately. &ldquo;And it aches because it is
      upright&mdash;because it is not to be satisfied with trifles. Answer it,
      how to live? To what purpose? There&mdash;take my godfather&mdash;he is
      wise! He says&mdash;create life! But he&rsquo;s the only one like this. Well,
      I&rsquo;ll ask him, wait! And everybody says&mdash;life has usurped us! Life has
      choked us. I shall ask these, too. And how can we create life? You must
      keep it in your hands to do this, you must be master over it. You cannot
      make even a pot, without taking the clay into your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; said Sasha, seriously. &ldquo;I think you ought to get married, that&rsquo;s
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Foma, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need a bridle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right! I am living with you&mdash;you are all of a kind, are you not?
      One is not sweeter than the other. I had one before you, of the same kind
      as you. No, but that one did it for love&rsquo;s sake. She had taken a liking to
      me&mdash;and consented; she was good&mdash;but, otherwise, she was in
      every way the same as you&mdash;though you are prettier than she. But I
      took a liking to a certain lady&mdash;a lady of noble birth! They said she
      led a loose life, but I did not get her. Yes, she was clever, intelligent;
      she lived in luxury. I used to think&mdash;that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ll taste the
      real thing! I did not get her&mdash;and, it may be, if I had succeeded,
      all would have taken a different turn. I yearned toward her. I thought&mdash;I
      could not tear myself away. While now that I have given myself to drink,
      I&rsquo;ve drowned her in wine&mdash;I am forgetting her&mdash;and that also is
      wrong. O man! You are a rascal, to be frank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma became silent and sank into meditation. And Sasha rose from the bench
      and paced the hut to and fro, biting her lips. Then she stopped short
      before him, and, clasping her hands to her head, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what? I&rsquo;ll leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where will you go?&rdquo; asked Foma, without lifting his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it&rsquo;s all the same!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always saying unnecessary things. It is lonesome with you. You
      make me sad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma lifted his head, looked at her and burst into mournful laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Is it possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do make me sad! Do you know? If I should reflect on it, I would
      understand what you say and why you say it&mdash;for I am also of that
      sort&mdash;when the time comes, I shall also think of all this. And then I
      shall be lost. But now it is too early for me. No, I want to live yet, and
      then, later, come what will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&mdash;will I, too, be lost?&rdquo; asked Foma, indifferently, already
      fatigued by his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; replied Sasha, calmly and confidently. &ldquo;All such people are
      lost. He, whose character is inflexible, and who has no brains&mdash;what
      sort of a life is his? We are like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no character at all,&rdquo; said Foma, stretching himself. Then after a
      moment&rsquo;s silence he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have no brains, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were silent for a minute, eyeing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I mean, in general? Afterward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afterward? I don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are leaving me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. Come, let&rsquo;s carouse some more before we part. Let&rsquo;s go to Kazan,
      and there we&rsquo;ll have a spree&mdash;smoke and flame! I&rsquo;ll sing your
      farewell song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; assented Foma. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite proper at leave taking. Eh, you
      devil! That&rsquo;s a merry life! Listen, Sasha. They say that women of your
      kind are greedy for money; are even thieves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them say,&rdquo; said Sasha, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel offended?&rdquo; asked Foma, with curiosity. &ldquo;But you are not
      greedy. It&rsquo;s advantageous to you to be with me. I am rich, and yet you are
      going away; that shows you&rsquo;re not greedy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; Sasha thought awhile and said with a wave of the hand: &ldquo;Perhaps I am
      not greedy&mdash;what of it? I am not of the very lowest of the street
      women. And against whom shall I feel a grudge? Let them say whatever they
      please. It will be only human talk, not the bellowing of bulls. And human
      holiness and honesty are quite familiar to me! Eh, how well I know them!
      If I were chosen as a judge, I would acquit the dead only l&rdquo; and bursting
      into malicious laughter, Sasha said: &ldquo;Well, that will do, we&rsquo;ve spoken
      enough nonsense. Sit down at the table!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the next day Foma and Sasha stood side by side on the
      gangway of a steamer which was approaching a harbour on the Ustye. Sasha&rsquo;s
      big black hat attracted everybody&rsquo;s attention by its deftly bent brim, and
      its white feathers, and Foma was ill at ease as he stood beside her, and
      felt as though inquisitive glances crawled over his perplexed face. The
      steamer hissed and quivered as it neared the landing-bridge, which was
      sprinkled by a waiting crowd of people attired in bright summer clothes,
      and it seemed to Foma that he noticed among the crowd of various faces and
      figures a person he knew, who now seemed to be hiding behind other
      people&rsquo;s backs, and yet lifted not his eye from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the cabin!&rdquo; said he to his companion uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t acquire the habit of hiding your sins from people,&rdquo; replied Sasha,
      with a smile. &ldquo;Have you perhaps noticed an acquaintance there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm. Yes. Somebody is watching me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nurse with a milk bottle? Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there you&rsquo;re neighing!&rdquo; said Foma, enraged, looking at her askance.
      &ldquo;Do you think I am afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see how brave you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see. I&rsquo;ll face anybody,&rdquo; said Foma, angrily, but after a close
      look at the crowd in the harbour his face suddenly assumed another
      expression, and he added softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s my godfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the very edge of the landing-stage stood Yakov Tarasovich, squeezed
      between two stout women, with his iron-like face lifted upward, and he
      waved his cap in the air with malicious politeness. His beard shook, his
      bald crown flashed, and his small eye pierced Foma like borers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a vulture!&rdquo; muttered Foma, raising his cap and nodding his head to
      his godfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      His bow evidently afforded great pleasure to Mayakin. The old man somehow
      coiled himself up, stamped his feet, and his face seemed beaming with a
      malicious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little boy will get money for nuts, it seems!&rdquo; Sasha teased Foma. Her
      words together with his godfather&rsquo;s smile seemed to have kindled a fire in
      Foma&rsquo;s breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see what is going to happen,&rdquo; hissed Foma, and suddenly he
      became as petrified in malicious calm. The steamer made fast, and the
      people rushed in a wave to the landing-place. Pressed by the crowd,
      Mayakin disappeared for awhile from the sight of his godson and appeared
      again with a maliciously triumphant smile. Foma stared at him fixedly,
      with knitted brow, and came toward him slowly pacing the gang planks. They
      jostled him in the back, they leaned on him, they squeezed him, and this
      provoked Foma still more. Now he came face to face with the old man, and
      the latter greeted him with a polite bow, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither are you travelling, Foma Ignatyich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About my affairs,&rdquo; replied Foma, firmly, without greeting his godfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s praiseworthy, my dear sir!&rdquo; said Yakov Tarasovich, all beaming
      with a smile. &ldquo;The lady with the feathers&mdash;what is she to you, may I
      ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s my mistress,&rdquo; said Foma, loud, without lowering his eyes at the
      keen look of his godfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sasha stood behind him calmly examining over his shoulder the little old
      man, whose head hardly reached Foma&rsquo;s chin. Attracted by Foma&rsquo;s loud
      words, the public looked at them, scenting a scandal. And Mayakin, too,
      perceived immediately the possibility of a scandal and instantly estimated
      correctly the quarrelsome mood of his godson. He contracted his wrinkles,
      bit his lips, and said to Foma, peaceably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to speak to you about. Will you come with me to the
      hotel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; for a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have no time, then? It&rsquo;s a plain thing, you must be making haste to
      wreck another barge, eh?&rdquo; said the old man, unable to contain himself any
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why not wreck them, since they can be wrecked?&rdquo; retorted Foma,
      passionately and firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you did not earn them yourself; why should you spare them?
      Well, come. And couldn&rsquo;t we drown that lady in the water for awhile?&rdquo; said
      Mayakin, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drive to the town, Sasha, and engage a room at the Siberian Inn. I&rsquo;ll be
      there shortly!&rdquo; said Foma and turning to Mayakin, he announced boldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ready! Let us go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Neither of them spoke on their way to the hotel. Foma, seeing that his
      godfather had to skip as he went in order to keep up with him, purposely
      took longer strides, and the fact that the old man could not keep step
      with him supported and strengthened in him the turbulent feeling of
      protest which he was by this time scarcely able to master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiter!&rdquo; said Mayakin, gently, on entering the hall of the hotel, and
      turning toward a remote corner, &ldquo;let us have a bottle of moorberry kvass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I want some cognac,&rdquo; ordered Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So-o! When you have poor cards you had better always play the lowest
      trump first!&rdquo; Mayakin advised him sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know my game!&rdquo; said Foma, seating himself by the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Come, come! Many play like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean as you do&mdash;boldly, but foolishly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I play so that either the head is smashed to pieces, or the wall broken
      in half,&rdquo; said Foma, hotly, and struck the table with his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you recovered from your drunkenness yet?&rdquo; asked Mayakin with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma seated himself more firmly in his chair, and, his face distorted with
      wrathful agitation, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfather, you are a sensible man. I respect you for your common sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my son!&rdquo; and Mayakin bowed, rising slightly, and leaning his
      hands against the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it. I want to tell you that I am no longer twenty. I am not
      a child any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; assented Mayakin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lived a good while, that goes
      without saying! If a mosquito had lived as long it might have grown as big
      as a hen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop your joking!&rdquo; Foma warned him, and he did it so calmly that Mayakin
      started back, and the wrinkles on his face quivered with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you come here for?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you&rsquo;ve done some nasty work here. So I want to find out whether
      there&rsquo;s much damage in it! You see, I am a relative of yours. And then, I
      am the only one you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are troubling yourself in vain. Do you know, papa, what I&rsquo;ll tell
      you? Either give me full freedom, or take all my business into your own
      hands. Take everything! Everything&mdash;to the last rouble!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This proposition burst forth from Foma altogether unexpectedly to himself;
      he had never before thought of anything like it. But now that he uttered
      such words to his godfather it suddenly became clear to him that if his
      godfather were to take from him all his property he would become a
      perfectly free man, he could go wherever he pleased, do whatever he
      pleased. Until this moment he had been bound and enmeshed with something,
      but he knew not his fetters and was unable to break them, while now they
      were falling off of themselves so simply, so easily. Both an alarming and
      a joyous hope blazed up within his breast, as though he noticed that
      suddenly light had begun to flash upon his turbid life, that a wide,
      spacious road lay open now before him. Certain images sprang up in his
      mind, and, watching their shiftings, he muttered incoherently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, this is better than anything! Take everything, and be done with it!
      And&mdash;as for me&mdash;I shall be free to go anywhere in the wide
      world! I cannot live like this. I feel as though weights were hanging on
      me, as though I were all bound. There&mdash;I must not go, this I must not
      do. I want to live in freedom, that I may know everything myself. I shall
      search life for myself. For, otherwise, what am I? A prisoner! Be kind,
      take everything. The devil take it all! Give me freedom, pray! What kind
      of a merchant am I? I do not like anything. And so&mdash;I would forsake
      men&mdash;everything. I would find a place for myself, I would find some
      kind of work, and would work. By God! Father! set me at liberty! For now,
      you see, I am drinking. I&rsquo;m entangled with that woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin looked at him, listened attentively to his words, and his face was
      stern, immobile as though petrified. A dull, tavern noise smote the air,
      some people went past them, they greeted Mayakin, but he saw nothing,
      staring fixedly at the agitated face of his godson, who smiled
      distractedly, both joyously and pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, my sour blackberry!&rdquo; said Mayakin, with a sigh, interrupting Foma&rsquo;s
      speech. &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve lost your way. And you&rsquo;re prating nonsense. I would
      like to know whether the cognac is to blame for it, or is it your
      foolishness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, &ldquo;this can surely be done. There were cases where
      people have cast away all their possessions and thus saved themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t in my time. Not people that are near to me!&rdquo; said Mayakin,
      sternly, &ldquo;or else I would have shown them how to go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many have become saints when they went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm! They couldn&rsquo;t have gone away from me! The matter is simple&mdash;you
      know how to play at draughts, don&rsquo;t you? Move from one place to another
      until you are beaten, and if you&rsquo;re not beaten then you have the queen.
      Then all ways are open to you. Do you understand? And why am I talking to
      you seriously? Psha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa! why don&rsquo;t you want it?&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me! If you are a chimney-sweep, go, carrion, on the roof! If
      you are a fireman, stand on the watch-tower! And each and every sort of
      men must have its own mode of life. Calves cannot roar like bears! If you
      live your own life; go on, live it! And don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, and don&rsquo;t
      creep where you don&rsquo;t belong. Arrange your life after your pattern.&rdquo; And
      from the dark lips of the old man gushed forth in a trembling, glittering
      stream the jarring, but confident and bold words so familiar to Foma.
      Seized with the thought of freedom, which seemed to him so easily
      possible, Foma did not listen to his words. This idea had eaten into his
      brains, and in his heart the desire grew stronger and stronger to sever
      all his connections with this empty and wearisome life, with his
      godfather, with the steamers, the barges and the carouses, with everything
      amidst which it was narrow and stifling for him to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man&rsquo;s words seemed to fall on him from afar; they were blended
      with the clatter of the dishes, with the scraping of the lackey&rsquo;s feet
      along the floor, with some one&rsquo;s drunken shouting. Not far from them sat
      four merchants at a table and argued loudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two and a quarter&mdash;and thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Luka Mitrich! How can I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him two and a half!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! You ought to give it, it&rsquo;s a good steamer, it tows
      briskly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellows, I can&rsquo;t. Two and a quarter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all this nonsense came to your head from your youthful passion!&rdquo; said
      Mayakin, importantly, accompanying his words with a rap on the table.
      &ldquo;Your boldness is stupidity; all these words of yours are nonsense. Would
      you perhaps go to the cloister? or have you perhaps a longing to go on the
      highways?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma listened in silence. The buzzing noise about him now seemed to move
      farther away from him. He pictured himself amid a vast restless crowd of
      people; without knowing why they bustled about hither and thither, jumped
      on one another; their eyes were greedily opened wide; they were shouting,
      cursing, falling, crushing one another, and they were all jostling about
      on one place. He felt bad among them because he did not understand what
      they wanted, because he had no faith in their words, and he felt that they
      had no faith in themselves, that they understood nothing. And if one were
      to tear himself away from their midst to freedom, to the edge of life, and
      thence behold them&mdash;then all would become clear to him. Then he would
      also understand what they wanted, and would find his own place among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I understand,&rdquo; said Mayakin, more gently, seeing Foma lost in
      thought, and assuming that he was reflecting on his words&mdash;&ldquo;I
      understand that you want happiness for yourself. Well, my friend, it is
      not to be easily seized. You must seek happiness even as they search for
      mushrooms in the wood, you must bend your back in search of it, and
      finding it, see whether it isn&rsquo;t a toad-stool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you will set me free?&rdquo; asked Foma, suddenly lifting his head, and
      Mayakin turned his eyes away from his fiery look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father! at least for a short time! Let me breathe, let me step aside from
      everything!&rdquo; entreated Foma. &ldquo;I will watch how everything goes on. And
      then&mdash;if not&mdash;I shall become a drunkard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense. Why do you play the fool?&rdquo; cried Mayakin, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then!&rdquo; replied Foma, calmly. &ldquo;Very well! You do not want it?
      Then there will be nothing! I&rsquo;ll squander it all! And there is nothing
      more for us to speak of. Goodbye! I&rsquo;ll set out to work, you&rsquo;ll see! It
      will afford you joy. Everything will go up in smoke!&rdquo; Foma was calm, he
      spoke with confidence; it seemed to him that since he had thus decided,
      his godfather could not hinder him. But Mayakin straightened himself in
      his chair and said, also plainly and calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you know how I can deal with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like!&rdquo; said Foma, with a wave of the hand. &ldquo;Well then. Now I like
      the following: I&rsquo;ll return to town and will see to it that you are
      declared insane, and put into a lunatic asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can this be done?&rdquo; asked Foma, distrustfully, but with a tone of fright
      in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can do everything, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma lowered his head, and casting a furtive glance at his godfather&rsquo;s
      face, shuddered, thinking:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll do it; he won&rsquo;t spare me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you play the fool seriously I must also deal with you seriously. I
      promised your father to make a man of you, and I will do it; if you cannot
      stand on your feet, I&rsquo;ll put you in irons. Then you will stand. Though I
      know all these holy words of yours are but ugly caprices that come from
      excessive drinking. But if you do not give that up, if you keep on
      behaving indecently, if you ruin, out of wantonness, the property
      accumulated by your father, I&rsquo;ll cover you all up. I&rsquo;ll have a bell forged
      over you. It is very inconvenient to fool with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin spoke gently. The wrinkles of his cheeks all rose upward, and his
      small eyes in their dark sockets were smiling sarcastically, coldly. And
      the wrinkles on his forehead formed an odd pattern, rising up to his bald
      crown. His face was stern and merciless, and breathed melancholy and
      coldness upon Foma&rsquo;s soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s no way out for me?&rdquo; asked Foma, gloomily. &ldquo;You are blocking
      all my ways?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a way. Go there! I shall guide you. Don&rsquo;t worry, it will be
      right! You will come just to your proper place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This self-confidence, this unshakable boastfulness aroused Foma&rsquo;s
      indignation. Thrusting his hands into his pockets in order not to strike
      the old man, he straightened himself in his chair and clinching his teeth,
      said, facing Mayakin closely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you boasting? What are you boasting of? Your own son, where is
      he? Your daughter, what is she? Eh, you&mdash;you life-builder! Well, you
      are clever. You know everything. Tell me, what for do you live? What for
      are you accumulating money? Do you think you are not going to die? Well,
      what then? You&rsquo;ve captured me. You&rsquo;ve taken hold of me, you&rsquo;ve conquered
      me. But wait, I may yet tear myself away from you! It isn&rsquo;t the end yet!
      Eh, you! What have you done for life? By what will you be remembered? My
      father, for instance, donated a lodging-house, and you&mdash;what have you
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin&rsquo;s wrinkles quivered and sank downward, wherefore his face assumed
      a sickly, weeping expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will you justify yourself?&rdquo; asked Foma, softly, without lifting his
      eyes from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold your tongue, you puppy!&rdquo; said the old man in a low voice, casting a
      glance of alarm about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve said everything! And now I&rsquo;m going! Hold me back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma rose from his chair, thrust his cap on his head, and measured the old
      man with abhorrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may go; but I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll catch you! It will come out as I say!&rdquo;
       said Yakov Tarasovich in a broken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go on a spree! I&rsquo;ll squander all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, we&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye! you hero,&rdquo; Foma laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye, for a short while! I&rsquo;ll not go back on my own. I love it. I love
      you, too. Never mind, you&rsquo;re a good fellow!&rdquo; said Mayakin, softly, and as
      though out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not love me, but teach me. But then, you cannot teach me the right
      thing!&rdquo; said Foma, as he turned his back on the old man and left the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yakov Tarasovich Mayakin remained in the tavern alone. He sat by the
      table, and, bending over it, made drawings of patterns on the tray,
      dipping his trembling finger in the spilt kvass, and his sharp-pointed
      head was sinking lower and lower over the table, as though he did not
      decipher, and could not make out what his bony finger was drawing on the
      tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beads of perspiration glistened on his bald crown, and as usual the
      wrinkles on his cheeks quivered with frequent, irritable starts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tavern a resounding tumult smote the air so that the window-panes
      were rattling. From the Volga were wafted the whistlings of steamers, the
      dull beating of the wheels upon the water, the shouting of the loaders&mdash;life
      was moving onward unceasingly and unquestionably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summoning the waiter with a nod Yakov Tarasovich asked him with peculiar
      intensity and impressiveness,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do I owe for all this?&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <p>
      PREVIOUS to his quarrel with Mayakin, Foma had caroused because of the
      weariness of life, out of curiosity, and half indifferently; now he led a
      dissipated life out of spite, almost in despair; now he was filled with a
      feeling of vengeance and with a certain insolence toward men, an insolence
      which astonished even himself at times. He saw that the people about him,
      like himself, lacked support and reason, only they did not understand
      this, or purposely would not understand it, so as not to hinder themselves
      from living blindly, and from giving themselves completely, without a
      thought, to their dissolute life. He found nothing firm in them, nothing
      steadfast; when sober, they seemed to him miserable and stupid; when
      intoxicated, they were repulsive to him, and still more stupid. None of
      them inspired him with respect, with deep, hearty interest; he did not
      even ask them what their names were; he forgot where and when he made
      their acquaintance, and regarding them with contemptuous curiosity, always
      longed to say and do something that would offend them. He passed days and
      nights with them in different places of amusement, and his acquaintances
      always depended just upon the category of each of these places. In the
      expensive and elegant restaurants certain sharpers of the better class of
      society surrounded him&mdash;gamblers, couplet singers, jugglers, actors,
      and property-holders who were ruined by leading depraved lives. At first
      these people treated him with a patronizing air, and boasted before him of
      their refined tastes, of their knowledge of the merits of wine and food,
      and then they courted favours of him, fawned upon him, borrowed of him
      money which he scattered about without counting, drawing it from the
      banks, and already borrowing it on promissory notes. In the cheap taverns
      hair-dressers, markers, clerks, functionaries and choristers surrounded
      him like vultures; and among these people he always felt better&mdash;freer.
      In these he saw plain people, not so monstrously deformed and distorted as
      that &ldquo;clean society&rdquo; of the elegant restaurants; these were less depraved,
      cleverer, better understood by him. At times they evinced wholesome,
      strong emotions, and there was always something more human in them. But,
      like the &ldquo;clean society,&rdquo; these were also eager for money, and shamelessly
      fleeced him, and he saw it and rudely mocked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, there were women. Physically healthy, but not sensual, Foma
      bought them, the dear ones and the cheap ones, the beautiful and the ugly,
      gave them large sums of money, changed them almost every week, and in
      general, he treated the women better than the men. He laughed at them,
      said to them disgraceful and offensive words, but he could never, even
      when half-drunk, rid himself of a certain bashfulness in their presence.
      They all, even the most brazen-faced, the strongest and the most
      shameless, seemed to him weak and defenseless, like small children. Always
      ready to thrash any man, he never laid a hand on women, although when
      irritated by something he sometimes abused them indecently. He felt that
      he was immeasurably stronger than any woman, and every woman seemed to him
      immeasurably more miserable than he was. Those of the women who led their
      dissolute lives audaciously, boasting of their depravity, called forth in
      Foma a feeling of bashfulness, which made him timid and awkward. One
      evening, during supper hour, one of these women, intoxicated and impudent,
      struck Foma on the cheek with a melon-rind. Foma was half-drunk. He turned
      pale with rage, rose from his chair, and thrusting his hands into his
      pockets, said in a fierce voice which trembled with indignation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You carrion, get out. Begone! Someone else would have broken your head
      for this. And you know that I am forbearing with you, and that my arm is
      never raised against any of your kind. Drive her away to the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few days after her arrival in Kazan, Sasha became the mistress of a
      certain vodka-distiller&rsquo;s son, who was carousing together with Foma. Going
      away with her new master to some place on the Kama, she said to Foma:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye, dear man! Perhaps we may meet again. We&rsquo;re both going the same
      way! But I advise you not to give your heart free rein. Enjoy yourself
      without looking back at anything. And then, when the gruel is eaten up,
      smash the bowl on the ground. Goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she impressed a hot kiss upon his lips, at which her eyes looked still
      darker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma was glad that she was leaving him, he had grown tired of her and her
      cold indifference frightened him. But now something trembled within him,
      he turned aside from her and said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will not live well together, then come back to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; she replied, and for some reason or other burst into hoarse
      laughter, which was uncommon with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus lived Foma, day in and day out, always turning around on one and the
      same place, amid people who were always alike, and who never inspired him
      with any noble feelings. And then he considered himself superior to them,
      because the thoughts of the possibility of freeing himself from this life
      was taking deeper and deeper root in his mind, because the yearning for
      freedom held him in an ever firmer embrace, because ever brighter were the
      pictures as he imagined himself drifting away to the border of life, away
      from this tumult and confusion. More than once, by night, remaining all by
      himself, he would firmly close his eyes and picture to himself a dark
      throng of people, innumerably great and even terrible in its immenseness.
      Crowded together somewhere in a deep valley, which was surrounded by
      hillocks, and filled with a dusty mist, this throng jostled one another on
      the same place in noisy confusion, and looked like grain in a hopper. It
      was as though an invisible millstone, hidden beneath the feet of the
      crowd, were grinding it, and people moved about it like waves&mdash;now
      rushing downward to be ground the sooner and disappear, now bursting
      upward in the effort to escape the merciless millstone. There were also
      people who resembled crabs just caught and thrown into a huge basket&mdash;clutching
      at one another, they twined about heavily, crawled somewhere and
      interfered with one another, and could do nothing to free themselves from
      captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma saw familiar faces amid the crowd: there his father is walking
      boldly, sturdily pushing aside and overthrowing everybody on his way; he
      is working with his long paws, massing everything with his chest, and
      laughing in thundering tones. And then he disappears, sinking somewhere in
      the depth, beneath the feet of the people. There, wriggling like a snake,
      now jumping on people&rsquo;s shoulders, now gliding between their feet, his
      godfather is working with his lean, but supple and sinewy body. Here Lubov
      is crying and struggling, following her father, with abrupt but faint
      movements, now remaining behind him, now nearing him again. Striding
      softly with a kind smile on her face, stepping aside from everybody, and
      making way for everyone, Aunt Anfisa is slowly moving along. Her image
      quivers in the darkness before Foma, like the modest flame of a wax
      candle. And it dies out and disappears in the darkness. Pelagaya is
      quickly going somewhere along a straight road. There Sophya Pavlovna
      Medinskaya is standing, her hands hanging impotently, just as she stood in
      her drawing-room when he saw her last. Her eyes were large, but some great
      fright gleams in them. Sasha, too, is here. Indifferent, paying no
      attention to the jostling, she is stoutly going straight into the very
      dregs of life, singing her songs at the top of her voice, her dark eyes
      fixed in the distance before her. Foma hears tumult, howls, laughter,
      drunken shouts, irritable disputes about copecks&mdash;songs and sobs
      hover over this enormous restless heap of living human bodies crowded into
      a pit. They jump, fall, crawl, crush one another, leap on one another&rsquo;s
      shoulders, grope everywhere like blind people, stumbling everywhere over
      others like themselves, struggle, and, falling, disappear from sight.
      Money rustles, soaring like bats over the heads of the people, and the
      people greedily stretch out their hands toward it, the gold and silver
      jingles, bottles rattle, corks pop, someone sobs, and a melancholy female
      voice sings:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so let us live while we can, And then&mdash;e&rsquo;en grass may cease to
      grow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This wild picture fastened itself firmly in Foma&rsquo;s mind, and growing
      clearer, larger and more vivid with each time it arose before him, rousing
      in his breast something chaotic, one great indefinite feeling into which
      fell, like streams into a river, fear and revolt and compassion and wrath
      and many another thing. All this boiled up within his breast into strained
      desire, which was thrusting it asunder into a desire whose power was
      choking him, and his eyes were filled with tears; he longed to shout, to
      howl like a beast, to frighten all the people, to check their senseless
      bustle, to pour into the tumult and vanity of their life something new,
      his own&mdash;to tell them certain loud firm words, to guide them all into
      one direction, and not one against another. He desired to seize them by
      their heads, to tear them apart one from another, to thrash some, to
      fondle others, to reproach them all, to illumine them with a certain fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing in him, neither the necessary words, nor the fire; all
      he had was the longing which was clear to him, but impossible of
      fulfillment. He pictured himself above life outside of the deep valley,
      wherein people were bustling about; he saw himself standing firmly on his
      feet and&mdash;speechless. He might have cried to the people:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See how you live! Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he might have abused them. But if they were to ask on hearing his
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how ought we to live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was perfectly clear to him that after such a question he would have to
      fly down head foremost from the heights there, beneath the feet of the
      throng, upon the millstone. And laughter would accompany him to his
      destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he was delirious under the pressure of this nightmare. Certain
      meaningless and unconnected words burst from his lips; he even perspired
      from this painful struggle within him. At times it occurred to him that he
      was going mad from intoxication, and that that was the reason why this
      terrible and gloomy picture was forcing itself into his mind. With a great
      effort of will he brushed aside these pictures and excitements; but as
      soon as he was alone and not very drunk, he was again seized by his
      delirium and again grew faint under its weight. And his thirst for freedom
      was growing more and more intense, torturing him by its force. But tear
      himself away from the shackles of his wealth he could not. Mayakin, who
      had Foma&rsquo;s full power of attorney to manage his affairs, acted now in such
      a way that Foma was bound to feel almost every day the burden of the
      obligations which rested upon him. People were constantly applying to him
      for payments, proposing to him terms for the transportation of freight.
      His employees overwhelmed him in person and by letter with trifles with
      which he had never before concerned himself, as they used to settle these
      trifles at their own risk. They looked for him and found him in the
      taverns, questioned him as to what and how it should be done; he would
      tell them sometimes without at all understanding in what way this or that
      should be done. He noticed their concealed contempt for him, and almost
      always saw that they did not do the work as he had ordered, but did it in
      a different and better way. In this he felt the clever hand of his
      godfather, and understood that the old man was thus pressing him in order
      to turn him to his way. And at the same time he noticed that he was not
      the master of his business, but only a component part of it, and an
      insignificant part at that. This irritated him and moved him farther away
      from the old man, it augumented his longing to tear himself away from his
      business, even at the cost of his own ruin. Infuriated, he flung money
      about the taverns and dives, but this did not last long. Yakov Tarasovich
      closed his accounts in the banks, withdrawing all deposits. Soon Foma
      began to feel that even on promissory notes, they now gave him the money
      not quite as willingly as before. This stung his vanity; and his
      indignation was roused, and he was frightened when he learned that his
      godfather had circulated a rumour in the business world that he, Foma, was
      out of his mind, and that, perhaps, it might become necessary to appoint a
      guardian for him. Foma did not know the limits of his godfather&rsquo;s power,
      and did not venture to take anyone&rsquo;s counsel in this matter. He was
      convinced that in the business world the old man was a power, and that he
      could do anything he pleased. At first it was painful for him to feel
      Mayakin&rsquo;s hand over him, but later he became reconciled to this, renounced
      everything, and resumed his restless, drunken life, wherein there was only
      one consolation&mdash;the people. With each succeeding day he became more
      and more convinced that they were more irrational and altogether worse
      than he&mdash;that they were not the masters of life, but its slaves, and
      that it was turning them around, bending and breaking them at its will,
      while they succumbed to it unfeelingly and resignedly, and none of them
      but he desired freedom. But he wanted it, and therefore proudly elevated
      himself above his drinking companions, not desiring to see in them
      anything but wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in a tavern a certain half-intoxicated man complained to him of
      his life. This was a small-sized, meagre man, with dim, frightened eyes,
      unshaven, in a short frock coat, and with a bright necktie. He blinked
      pitifully, his ears quivered spasmodically, and his soft little voice also
      trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve struggled hard to make my way among men; I&rsquo;ve tried everything, I&rsquo;ve
      worked like a bull. But life jostled me aside, crushed me under foot, gave
      me no chance. All my patience gave way. Eh! and so I&rsquo;ve taken to drink. I
      feel that I&rsquo;ll be ruined. Well, that&rsquo;s the only way open to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; said Foma with contempt. &ldquo;Why did you want to make your way among
      men? You should have kept away from them, to the right. Standing aside,
      you might have seen where your place was among them, and then gone right
      to the point!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your words.&rdquo; The little man shook his close-cropped,
      angular head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma laughed, self-satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it for you to understand it?&rdquo; &ldquo;No; do you know, I think that he whom
      God decreed&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not God, but man arranges life!&rdquo; Foma blurted out, and was even himself
      astonished at the audacity of his words. And the little man glancing at
      him askance also shrank timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has God given you reason?&rdquo; asked Foma, recovering from his embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; that is to say, as much as is the share of a small man,&rdquo; said
      Foma&rsquo;s interlocutor irresolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and you have no right to ask of Him a single grain more! Make your
      own life by your own reason. And God will judge you. We are all in His
      service. And in His eyes we are all of equal value. Understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It happened very often that Foma would suddenly say something which seemed
      audacious even to himself, and which, at the same time, elevated him in
      his own eyes. There were certain unexpected, daring thoughts and words,
      which suddenly flashed like sparks, as though an impression produced them
      from Foma&rsquo;s brains. And he noticed more than once that whatever he had
      carefully thought out beforehand was expressed by him not quite so well,
      and more obscure, than that which suddenly flashed up in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma lived as though walking in a swamp, in danger of sinking at each step
      in the mire and slime, while his godfather, like a river loach, wriggled
      himself on a dry, firm little spot, vigilantly watching the life of his
      godson from afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his quarrel with Foma, Yakov Tarasovich returned home, gloomy and
      pensive. His eyes flashed drily, and he straightened himself like a
      tightly-stretched string. His wrinkles shrank painfully, his face seemed
      to have become smaller and darker, and when Lubov saw him in this state it
      appeared to her that he was seriously ill, but that he was forcing and
      restraining himself. Mutely and nervously the old man flung himself about
      the room, casting in reply to his daughter&rsquo;s questions, dry curt words,
      and finally shouted to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me alone! You see it has nothing to do with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt sorry for him when she noticed the gloomy and melancholy
      expression of his keen, green eyes; she made it her duty to question him
      as to what had happened to him, and when he seated himself at the
      dinner-table she suddenly approached him, placed her hands on his
      shoulders, and looking down into his face, asked him tenderly and
      anxiously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, are you ill? tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her caresses were extremely rare; they always softened the lonely old man,
      and though he did not respond to them for some reason or other he
      nevertheless could not help appreciating them. And now he shrugged his
      shoulders, thus throwing off her hands and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, go to your place. How the itching curiosity of Eve gives you no
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Lubov did not go away; persistingly looking into his eyes, she asked,
      with an offended tone in her voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, why do you always speak to me in such a way as though I were a
      small child, or very stupid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you are grown up and yet not very clever. Yes! That&rsquo;s the whole
      story! Go, sit down and eat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She walked away and silently seated herself opposite her father,
      compressing her lips for affront. Contrary to his habits Mayakin ate
      slowly, stirring his spoon in his plate of cabbage-soup for a long time,
      and examining the soup closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your obstructed mind could but comprehend your father&rsquo;s thoughts!&rdquo;
       said he, suddenly, as he sighed with a sort of whistling sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lubov threw her spoon aside and almost with tears in her voice, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you insult me, papa? You see that I am alone, always alone! You
      understand how difficult my life is, and you never say a single kind word
      to me. You never say anything to me! And you are also lonely; life is
      difficult for you too, I can see it. You find it very hard to live, but
      you alone are to blame for it! You alone!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Balaam&rsquo;s she-ass has also started to talk!&rdquo; said the old man,
      laughing. &ldquo;Well! what will be next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very proud of your wisdom, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t good; and it pains me greatly. Why do you repulse me? You know
      that, save you, I have no one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears leaped to her eyes; her father noticed them, and his face quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were not a girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If you had as much brains as
      Marfa Poosadnitza, for instance. Eh, Lubov? Then I&rsquo;d laugh at everybody,
      and at Foma. Come now, don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wiped her eyes and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Foma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s rebellious. Ha! ha! he says: &lsquo;Take away my property, give me
      freedom!&rsquo; He wants to save his soul in the kabak. That&rsquo;s what entered
      Foma&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is this?&rdquo; asked Lubov, irresolutely. She wanted to say that
      Foma&rsquo;s desire was good, that it was a noble desire if it were earnest, but
      she feared to irritate her father with her words, and she only gazed at
      him questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Mayakin, excitedly, trembling. &ldquo;That either comes to
      him from excessive drinking, or else&mdash;Heaven forbid&mdash;from his
      mother, the orthodox spirit. And if this heathenish leaven is going to
      rise in him I&rsquo;ll have to struggle hard with him! There will be a great
      conflict between us. He has come out, breast foremost, against me; he has
      at once displayed great audacity. He&rsquo;s young&mdash;there&rsquo;s not much
      cunning in him as yet. He says: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll drink away everything, everything
      will go up in smoke! I&rsquo;ll show you how to drink!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin lifted his hand over his head, and, clenching his fist, threatened
      furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you? Who established the business? Who built it up? You? Your
      father. Forty years of labour were put into it, and you wish to destroy
      it? We must all go to our places here all together as one man, there
      cautiously, one by one. We merchants, tradesmen, have for centuries
      carried Russia on our shoulders, and we are still carrying it. Peter the
      Great was a Czar of divine wisdom, he knew our value. How he supported us!
      He had printed books for the express purpose of teaching us business.
      There I have a book which was printed at his order by Polidor Virgily
      Oorbansky, about inventory, printed in 1720. Yes, one must understand
      this. He understood it, and cleared the way for us. And now we stand on
      our own feet, and we feel our place. Clear the way for us! We have laid
      the foundation of life, instead of bricks we have laid ourselves in the
      earth. Now we must build the stories. Give us freedom of action! That&rsquo;s
      where we must hold our course. That&rsquo;s where the problem lies; but Foma
      does not comprehend this. But he must understand it, must resume the work.
      He has his father&rsquo;s means. When I die mine will be added to his. Work, you
      puppy! And he is raving. No, wait! I&rsquo;ll lift you up to the proper point!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man was choking with agitation and with flashing eyes looked at
      his daughter so furiously as though Foma were sitting in her place. His
      agitation frightened Lubov, but she lacked the courage to interrupt her
      father, and she looked at his stern and gloomy face in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road has been paved by our fathers, and you must walk on it. I have
      worked for fifty years to what purpose? That my children may resume it
      after I am gone. My children! Where are my children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man drooped his head mournfully, his voice broke down, and he said
      sadly, as if he were speaking unto himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One is a convict, utterly ruined; the other, a drunkard. I have little
      hope in him. My daughter, to whom, then, shall I leave my labour before my
      death? If I had but a son-in-law. I thought Foma would become a man and
      would be sharpened up, then I would give you unto him, and with you all I
      have&mdash;there! But Foma is good for nothing, and I see no one else in
      his stead. What sort of people we have now! In former days the people were
      as of iron, while now they are of india-rubber. They are all bending now.
      And nothing&mdash;they have no firmness in them. What is it? Why is it
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin looked at his daughter with alarm. She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he asked her, &ldquo;what do you need? How, in your opinion, is it
      proper to live? What do you want? You have studied, read, tell me what is
      it that you need?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The questions fell on Lubov&rsquo;s head quite unexpectedly to her, and she was
      embarrassed. She was pleased that her father asked her about this matter,
      and was at the same time afraid to reply, lest she should be lowered in
      his estimation. And then, gathering courage, as though preparing to jump
      across the table, she said irresolutely and in a trembling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That all the people should be happy and contented; that all the people
      should be equal, all the people have an equal right to life, to the bliss
      of life, all must have freedom, even as they have air. And equality in
      everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of her agitated speech her father looked at her face with
      anxious curiosity in his eyes, but as she went on hastily hurling her
      words at him his eyes assumed an altogether different expression, and
      finally he said to her with calm contempt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it before&mdash;you are a gilded fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her head, but immediately raised it and exclaimed sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said so yourself&mdash;freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better hold your tongue!&rdquo; the old man shouted at her rudely. &ldquo;You
      cannot see even that which is visibly forced outside of each man. How can
      all the people be happy and equal, since each one wants to be above the
      other? Even the beggar has his pride and always boasts of something or
      other before other people. A small child, even he wants to be first among
      his playmates. And one man will never yield to another; only fools believe
      in it. Each man has his own soul, and his own face; only those who love
      not their souls and care not for their faces can be planed down to the
      same size. Eh, you! You&rsquo;ve read much trash, and you&rsquo;ve devoured it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bitter reproach and biting contempt were expressed on the old man&rsquo;s face.
      He noisily pushed his chair away from the table, jumped up, and folding
      his hands behind his back, began to dart about in the room with short
      steps, shaking his head and saying something to himself in an angry,
      hissing whisper. Lubov, pale with emotion and anger, feeling herself
      stupid and powerless before him, listening to his whisper, and her heart
      palpitated wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am left alone, alone, like Job. Oh Lord! What shall I do? Oh, alone! Am
      I not wise? Am I not clever? But life has outwitted me also. What does it
      love? Whom does it fondle? It beats the good, and suffers not the bad to
      go unpunished, and no one understands life&rsquo;s justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl began to feel painfully sorry for the old man; she was seized
      with an intense yearning to help him; she longed to be of use to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following him with burning eyes, she suddenly said in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa, dear! do not grieve. Taras is still alive. Perhaps he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin stopped suddenly as though nailed to the spot, and he slowly
      lifted his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tree that grew crooked in its youth and could not hold out will
      certainly break when it&rsquo;s old. But nevertheless, even Taras is a straw to
      me now. Though I doubt whether he is better than Foma. Gordyeeff has a
      character, he has his father&rsquo;s daring. He can take a great deal on
      himself. But Taraska, you recalled him just in time. Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the old man, who a moment ago had lost his courage to the point of
      complaining, and, grief-stricken had run about the room like a mouse in a
      trap, now calmly and firmly walked up with a careworn face to the table,
      carefully adjusted his chair, and seated himself, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to sound Taraska. He lives in Usolye at some factory. I was
      told by some merchants&mdash;they&rsquo;re making soda there, I believe. I&rsquo;ll
      find out the particulars. I&rsquo;ll write to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to write to him, papa!&rdquo; begged Lubov, softly, flushing,
      trembling with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; asked Mayakin, casting a brief glance at her; he then became
      silent, thought awhile and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. That&rsquo;s even better! Write to him. Ask him whether he
      isn&rsquo;t married, how he lives, what he thinks. But then I&rsquo;ll tell you what
      to write when the time has come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it at once, papa,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is necessary to marry you off the sooner. I am keeping an eye on a
      certain red-haired fellow. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be stupid. He&rsquo;s been
      polished abroad, by the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Smolin, papa?&rdquo; asked Lubov, inquisitively and anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And supposing it is he, what of it?&rdquo; inquired Yakov Tarasovich in a
      business-like tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, I don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; replied Lubov, indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make you acquainted. It&rsquo;s time, Lubov, it&rsquo;s time. Our hopes for
      Foma are poor, although I do not give him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not reckon on Foma&mdash;what is he to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s wrong. If you had been cleverer perhaps he wouldn&rsquo;t have gone
      astray! Whenever I used to see you together, I thought: &lsquo;My girl will
      attract the fellow to herself! That will be a fine affair!&rsquo; But I was
      wrong. I thought that you would know what is to your advantage without
      being told of it. That&rsquo;s the way, my girl!&rdquo; said the father,
      instructively.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became thoughtful as she listened to his impressive speech. Robust and
      strong, Lubov was thinking of marriage more and more frequently of late,
      for she saw no other way out of her loneliness. The desire to forsake her
      father and go away somewhere in order to study something, to do something.
      This desire she had long since overcome, even as she conquered in herself
      many another longing just as keen, but shallow and indefinite. From the
      various books she had read a thick sediment remained within her, and
      though it was something live it had the life of a protoplasm. This
      sediment developed in the girl a feeling of dis-satisfaction with her
      life, a yearning toward personal independence, a longing to be freed from
      the heavy guardianship of her father, but she had neither the power to
      realize these desires, nor the clear conception of their realization. But
      nature had its influence on her, and at the sight of young mothers with
      children in their arms Lubov often felt a sad and mournful languor within
      her. At times stopping before the mirror she sadly scrutinized in it her
      plump, fresh face with dark circles around her eyes, and she felt sorry
      for herself. She felt that life was going past her, forgetting her
      somewhere on the side. Now listening to her father&rsquo;s words she pictured to
      herself what sort of man Smolin might be. She had met him when he was yet
      a Gymnasium student, his face was covered with freckles, he was
      snub-nosed, always clean, sedate and tiresome. He danced heavily,
      awkwardly, he talked uninterestingly. A long time had passed since then,
      he had been abroad, had studied something there, how was he now? From
      Smolin her thoughts darted to her brother, and with a sinking heart she
      thought: what would he say in reply to her letter? What sort of a man was
      he? The image of her brother as she had pictured it to herself prevented
      her from seeing both her father and Smolin, and she had already made up
      her mind not to consent to marry before meeting Taras, when suddenly her
      father shouted to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Lubovka! Why are you thoughtful? What are you thinking of mostly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, everything goes so swiftly,&rdquo; replied Luba, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What goes swiftly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything. A week ago it was impossible to speak with you about Taras,
      while now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tis need, my girl! Need is a power, it bends a steel rod into a spring.
      And steel is stubborn. Taras, we&rsquo;ll see what he is! Man is to be
      appreciated by his resistance to the power of life; if it isn&rsquo;t life that
      wrings him, but he that wrings life to suit himself, my respects to that
      man! Allow me to shake your hand, let&rsquo;s run our business together. Eh, I
      am old. And how very brisk life has become now! With each succeeding year
      there is more and more interest in it, more and more relish to it! I wish
      I could live forever, I wish I could act all the time!&rdquo; The old man
      smacked his lips, rubbed his hands, and his small eyes gleamed greedily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are a thin-blooded lot! Ere you have grown up you are already
      overgrown and withered. You live like an old radish. And the fact that
      life is growing fairer and fairer is incomprehensible to you. I have lived
      sixty-seven years on this earth, and though I am now standing close to my
      grave I can see that in former years, when I was young, there were fewer
      flowers on earth, and the flowers were not quite as beautiful as they are
      now. Everything is growing more beautiful! What buildings we have now!
      What different trade implements. What huge steamers! A world of brains has
      been put into everything! You look and think; what clever fellows you are&mdash;Oh
      people! You merit reward and respect! You&rsquo;ve arranged life cleverly.
      Everything is good, everything is pleasant. Only you, our successors, you
      are devoid of all live feelings! Any little charlatan from among the
      commoners is cleverer than you! Take that Yozhov, for instance, what is
      he? And yet he represents himself as judge over us, and even over life
      itself&mdash;he has courage. But you, pshaw! You live like beggars! In
      your joy you are beasts, in your misfortune vermin! You are rotten! They
      ought to inject fire into your veins, they ought to take your skin off and
      strew salt upon your raw flesh, then you would have jumped!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yakov Tarasovich, small-sized, wrinkled and bony, with black, broken teeth
      in his mouth, bald-headed and dark, as though burned by the heat of life
      and smoked in it, trembled in vehement agitation, showering jarring words
      of contempt upon his daughter, who was young, well-grown and plump. She
      looked at him with a guilty expression in her eyes, smiled confusedly, and
      in her heart grew a greater and greater respect for the live old man who
      was so steadfast in his desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      And Foma went on straying and raving, passing his days and nights in
      taverns and dens, and mastering more and more firmly his
      contemptuously-hateful bearing toward the people that surrounded him. At
      times they awakened in him a sad yearning to find among them some sort of
      resistance to his wicked feeling, to meet a worthy and courageous man who
      would cause him to blush with shame by his burning reproach. This yearning
      became clearer&mdash;each time it sprang up in him it was a longing for
      assistance on the part of a man who felt that he had lost his way and was
      perishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brethren!&rdquo; he cried one day, sitting by the table in a tavern,
      half-intoxicated, and surrounded by certain obscure and greedy people, who
      ate and drank as though they had not had a piece of bread in their mouths
      for many a long day before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brethren! I feel disgusted. I am tired of you! Beat me unmercifully,
      drive me away! You are rascals, but you are nearer to one another than to
      me. Why? Am I not a drunkard and a rascal as well? And yet I am a stranger
      to you! I can see I am a stranger. You drink out of me and secretly you
      spit upon me. I can feel it! Why do you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To be sure, they could treat him in a different way. In the depth of his
      soul perhaps not one of them considered himself lower than Foma, but he
      was rich, and this hindered them from treating him more as a companion,
      and then he always spoke certain comically wrathful, conscience-rending
      words, and this embarrassed them. Moreover, he was strong and ready to
      fight, and they dared not say a word against him. And that was just what
      he wanted. He wished more and more intensely that one of these people he
      despised would stand up against him, face to face, and would tell him
      something strong, which, like a lever, would turn him aside from the
      sloping road, whose danger he felt, and whose filth he saw, being filled
      with helpless aversion for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Foma found what he needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, irritated by the lack of attention for him, he cried to his
      drinking-companions:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You boys, keep quiet, every one of you! Who gives you to drink and to
      eat? Have you forgotten it? I&rsquo;ll bring you in order! I&rsquo;ll show you how to
      respect me! Convicts! When I speak you must all keep quiet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, indeed, all became silent; either for fear lest they might lose his
      good will, or, perhaps, afraid that he, that healthy and strong beast,
      might beat them. They sat in silence about a minute, concealing their
      anger at him, bending over the plates and attempting to hide from him
      their fright and embarrassment. Foma measured them with a self-satisfied
      look, and gratified by their slavish submissiveness, said boastfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You&rsquo;ve grown dumb now, that&rsquo;s the way! I am strict! I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You sluggard!&rdquo; came some one&rsquo;s calm, loud exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wha-at?&rdquo; roared Foma, jumping up from his chair. &ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a certain, strange, shabby-looking man arose at the end of the table;
      he was tall, in a long frock-coat, with a heap of grayish hair on his
      large head. His hair was stiff, standing out in all directions in thick
      locks, his face was yellow, unshaven, with a long, crooked nose. To Foma
      it seemed that he resembled a swab with which the steamer decks are
      washed, and this amused the half-intoxicated fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How fine!&rdquo; said he, sarcastically. &ldquo;What are you snarling at, eh? Do you
      know who I am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the gesture of a tragic actor the man stretched out to Foma his hand,
      with its long, pliant fingers like those of a juggler, and he said in a
      deep hoarse basso:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the rotten disease of your father, who, though he was a
      plunderer, was nevertheless a worthy man in comparison with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Because of the unexpectedness of this, and because of his wrath, Foma&rsquo;s
      heart shrank. He fiercely opened his eyes wide and kept silent, finding no
      words to reply to this insolence. And the man, standing before him, went
      on hoarsely, with animation, beastlike rolling his large, but dim and
      swollen, eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You demand of us respect for you, you fool! How have you merited it? Who
      are you? A drunkard, drinking away the fortune of your father. You savage!
      You ought to be proud that I, a renowned artist, a disinterested and
      faithful worshipper at the shrine of art, drink from the same bottle with
      you! This bottle contains sandal and molasses, infused with snuff-tobacco,
      while you think it is port wine. It is your license for the name of savage
      and ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you jailbird!&rdquo; roared Foma, rushing toward the artist. But he was
      seized and held back. Struggling in the arms of those that seized him, he
      was compelled to listen without replying, to the thundering, deep and
      heavy bass of the man who resembled a swab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have thrown to men a few copecks out of the stolen roubles, and you
      consider yourself a hero! You are twice a thief. You have stolen the
      roubles and now you are stealing gratitude for your few copecks! But I
      shall not give it to you! I, who have devoted all my life to the
      condemnation of vice, I stand before you and say openly: &lsquo;You are a fool
      and a beggar because you are too rich! Here lies the wisdom: all the rich
      are beggars.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s how the famous coupletist, Rimsky-Kannibalsky, serves
      Truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma was now standing meekly among the people that had closely surrounded
      him, and he eagerly listened to the coupletist&rsquo;s thundering words, which
      now aroused in him a sensation as though somebody was scratching a sore
      spot, and thus soothing the acute itching of the pain. The people were
      excited; some attempted to check the coupletist&rsquo;s flow of eloquence,
      others wanted to lead Foma away somewhere. Without saying a word he pushed
      them aside and listened, more and more absorbed by the intense pleasure of
      humiliation which he felt in the presence of these people. The pain
      irritated by the words of the coupletist, caressed Foma&rsquo;s soul more and
      more passionately, and the coupletist went on thundering, intoxicated with
      the impurity of his accusation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think that you are the master of life? You are the low slave of the
      rouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Someone in the crowd hiccoughed, and, evidently displeased with himself
      for this, cursed each time he hiccoughed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And a certain, unshaven, fat-faced man took pity on Foma, or, perhaps,
      became tired of witnessing that scene, and, waving his hands, he drawled
      out plaintively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, drop that! It isn&rsquo;t good! For we are all sinners! Decidedly
      all, believe me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, speak on!&rdquo; muttered Foma. &ldquo;Say everything! I won&rsquo;t touch you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mirrors on the walls reflected this drunken confusion, and the people,
      as reflected in the mirrors, seemed more disgusting and hideous than they
      were in reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not want to speak!&rdquo; exclaimed the coupletist, &ldquo;I do not want to cast
      the pearls of truth and of my wrath before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rushed forward, and raising his head majestically, turned toward the
      door with tragic footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie!&rdquo; said Foma, attempting to follow him. &ldquo;Hold on! you have made me
      agitated, now calm me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They seized him, surrounded him and shouted something to him while he was
      rushing forward, overturning everybody. When he met tactile obstacles on
      his way the struggle with them gave him ease, uniting all his riotous
      feelings into one yearning to overthrow that which hindered him. And now,
      after he had jostled them all aside and rushed out into the street, he was
      already less agitated. Standing on the sidewalk he looked about the street
      and thought with shame:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I permit that swab to mock me and abuse my father as a thief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was dark and quiet about him, the moon was shining brightly, and a
      light refreshing breeze was blowing. Foma held his face to the cool breeze
      as he walked against the wind with rapid strides, timidly looking about on
      all sides, and wishing that none of the company from the tavern would
      follow him. He understood that he had lowered himself in the eyes of all
      these people. As he walked he thought of what he had come to: a sharper
      had publicly abused him in disgraceful terms, while he, the son of a
      well-known merchant, had not been able to repay him for his mocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It serves me right!&rdquo; thought Foma, sadly and bitterly. &ldquo;That serves me
      right! Don&rsquo;t lose your head, understand. And then again, I wanted it
      myself. I interfered with everybody, so now, take your share!&rdquo; These
      thoughts made him feel painfully sorry for himself. Seized and sobered by
      them he kept on strolling along the streets, and searching for something
      strong and firm in himself. But everything within him was confused; it
      merely oppressed his heart, without assuming any definite forms. As in a
      painful dream he reached the river, seated himself on the beams by the
      shore, and began to look at the calm dark water, which was covered with
      tiny ripples. Calmly and almost noiselessly flowed on the broad, mighty
      river, carrying enormous weights upon its bosom. The river was all covered
      with black vessels, the signal lights and the stars were reflected in its
      water; the tiny ripples, murmuring softly, were gently breaking against
      the shore at the very feet of Foma. Sadness was breathed down from the
      sky, the feeling of loneliness oppressed Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord Jesus Christ!&rdquo; thought he, sadly gazing at the sky. &ldquo;What a
      failure I am. There is nothing in me. God has put nothing into me. Of what
      use am I? Oh Lord Jesus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the recollection of Christ Foma felt somewhat better&mdash;his
      loneliness seemed alleviated, and heaving a deep sigh, he began to address
      God in silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord Jesus Christ! Other people do not understand anything either, but
      they think that all is known to them, and therefore it is easier for them
      to live. While I&mdash;I have no justification. Here it is night, and I am
      alone, I have no place to go, I am unable to say anything to anybody. I
      love no one&mdash;only my godfather, and he is soulless. If Thou hadst but
      punished him somehow! He thinks there is none cleverer and better on earth
      than himself. While Thou sufferest it. And the same with me. If some
      misfortune were but sent to me. If some illness were to overtake me. But
      here I am as strong as iron. I am drinking, leading a gay life. I live in
      filth, but the body does not even rust, and only my soul aches. Oh Lord!
      To what purpose is such a life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vague thoughts of protest flashed one after another through the mind of
      the lonely, straying man, while the silence about him was growing deeper,
      and night ever darker and darker. Not far from the shore lay a boat at
      anchor; it rocked from side to side, and something was creaking in it as
      though moaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How am I to free myself from such a life as this?&rdquo; reflected Foma,
      staring at the boat. &ldquo;And what occupation is destined to be mine?
      Everybody is working.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he was struck by a thought which appeared great to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hard work is cheaper than easy work! Some man will give himself up
      entire to his work for a rouble, while another takes a thousand with one
      finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was pleasantly roused by this thought. It seemed to him that he
      discovered another falsehood in the life of man, another fraud which they
      conceal. He recalled one of his stokers, the old man Ilya, who, for ten
      copecks, used to be on watch at the fireplace out of his turn, working for
      a comrade eight hours in succession, amid suffocating heat. One day, when
      he had fallen sick on account of overwork, he was lying on the bow of the
      steamer, and when Foma asked him why he was thus ruining himself, Ilya
      replied roughly and sternly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because every copeck is more necessary to me than a hundred roubles to
      you. That&rsquo;s why!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, saying this, the old man turned his body, which was burning with
      pain, with its back to Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflecting on the stoker his thoughts suddenly and without any effort,
      embraced all those petty people that were doing hard work. He wondered,
      Why do they live? What pleasure is it for them to live on earth? They
      constantly do but their dirty, hard work, they eat poorly, are poorly
      clad, they drink. One man is sixty years old, and yet he keeps on toiling
      side by side with the young fellows. And they all appeared to Foma as a
      huge pile of worms, which battled about on earth just to get something to
      eat. In his memory sprang up his meetings with these people, one after
      another&mdash;their remarks about life&mdash;now sarcastic and mournful,
      now hopelessly gloomy remarks&mdash;their wailing songs. And now he also
      recalled how one day in the office Yefim had said to the clerk who hired
      the sailors:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some Lopukhin peasants have come here to hire themselves out, so don&rsquo;t
      give them more than ten roubles a month. Their place was burned down to
      ashes last summer, and they are now in dire need&mdash;they&rsquo;ll work for
      ten roubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sitting on the beams, Foma rocked his whole body to and fro, and out of
      the darkness, from the river, various human figures appeared silently
      before him&mdash;sailors, stokers, clerks, waiters, half-intoxicated
      painted women, and tavern-loungers. They floated in the air like shadows;
      something damp and brackish came from them, and the dark, dense throng
      moved on slowly, noiselessly and swiftly, like clouds in an autumn sky.
      The soft splashing of the waves poured into his soul like sadly sighing
      music. Far away, somewhere on the other bank of the river, burned a
      wood-pile; embraced by the darkness on all sides, it was at times almost
      absorbed by it, and in the darkness it trembled, a reddish spot scarcely
      visible to the eye. But now the fire flamed up again, the darkness
      receded, and it was evident that the flame was striving upward. And then
      it sank again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord, Oh Lord!&rdquo; thought Foma, painfully and bitterly, feeling that
      grief was oppressing his heart with ever greater power. &ldquo;Here I am, alone,
      even as that fire. Only no light comes from me, nothing but fumes and
      smoke. If I could only meet a wise man! Someone to speak to. It is utterly
      impossible for me to live alone. I cannot do anything. I wish I might meet
      a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Far away, on the river, two large purple fires appeared, and high above
      them was a third. A dull noise resounded in the distance, something black
      was moving toward Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A steamer going up stream,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;There may be more than a hundred
      people aboard, and none of them give a single thought to me. They all know
      whither they are sailing. Every one of them has something that is his own.
      Every one, I believe, understands what he wants. But what do I want? And
      who will tell it to me? Where is such a man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lights of the steamer were reflected in the river, quivering in it;
      the illumined water rushed away from it with a dull murmur, and the
      steamer looked like a huge black fish with fins of fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days elapsed after this painful night, and Foma caroused again. It
      came about by accident and against his will. He had made up his mind to
      restrain himself from drinking, and so went to dinner in one of the most
      expensive hotels in town, hoping to find there none of his familiar
      drinking-companions, who always selected the cheaper and less respectable
      places for their drinking bouts. But his calculation proved to be wrong;
      he at once came into the friendly joyous embrace of the brandy-distiller&rsquo;s
      son, who had taken Sasha as mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran up to Foma, embraced him and burst into merry laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a meeting! This is the third day I have eaten here, and I am
      wearied by this terrible lonesomeness. There is not a decent man in the
      whole town, so I have had to strike up an acquaintance with newspaper men.
      They&rsquo;re a gay lot, although at first they played the aristocrat and kept
      sneering at me. After awhile we all got dead drunk. They&rsquo;ll be here again
      today&mdash;I swear by the fortune of my father! I&rsquo;ll introduce you to
      them. There is one writer of feuilletons here; you know, that some one who
      always lauded you, what&rsquo;s his name? An amusing fellow, the devil take him!
      Do you know it would be a good thing to hire one like that for personal
      use! Give him a certain sum of money and order him to amuse! How&rsquo;s that? I
      had a certain coupletist in my employ,&mdash;it was rather entertaining to
      be with him. I used to say to him sometimes: &lsquo;Rimsky! give us some
      couplets!&rsquo; He would start, I tell you, and he&rsquo;d make you split your sides
      with laughter. It&rsquo;s a pity, he ran off somewhere. Have you had dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. And how&rsquo;s Aleksandra?&rdquo; asked Foma, somewhat deafened by the loud
      speech of this tall, frank, red-faced fellow clad in a motley costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you know,&rdquo; said the latter with a frown, &ldquo;that Aleksandra of
      yours is a nasty woman! She&rsquo;s so obscure, it&rsquo;s tiresome to be with her,
      the devil take her! She&rsquo;s as cold as a frog,&mdash;brrr! I guess I&rsquo;ll send
      her away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cold&mdash;that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Foma and became pensive. &ldquo;Every person must
      do his work in a first class manner,&rdquo; said the distiller&rsquo;s son,
      instructively. &ldquo;And if you become some one&rsquo;s s mistress you must perform
      your duty in the best way possible, if you are a decent woman. Well, shall
      we have a drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had a drink. And naturally they got drunk. A large and noisy company
      gathered in the hotel toward evening. And Foma, intoxicated, but sad and
      calm, spoke to them with heavy voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I understand it: some people are worms, others sparrows.
      The sparrows are the merchants. They peck the worms. Such is their
      destined lot. They are necessary But I and you&mdash;all of you&mdash;are
      to no purpose. We live so that we cannot be compared to anything&mdash;without
      justification, merely at random. And we are utterly unnecessary. But even
      these here, and everybody else, to what purpose are they? You must
      understand that. Brethren! We shall all burst! By God! And why shall we
      burst? Because there is always something superfluous in us, there is
      something superfluous in our souls. And all our life is superfluous!
      Comrades! I weep. To what purpose am I? I am unnecessary! Kill me, that I
      may die; I want to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he wept, shedding many drunken tears. A drunken, small-sized, swarthy
      man sat down close to him, began to remind him of something, tried to kiss
      him, and striking a knife against the table, shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True! Silence! These are powerful words! Let the elephants and the
      mammoths of the disorder of life speak! The raw Russian conscience speaks
      holy words! Roar on, Gordyeeff! Roar at everything!&rdquo; And again he clutched
      at Foma&rsquo;s shoulders, flung himself on his breast, raising to Foma&rsquo;s face
      his round, black, closely-cropped head, which was ceaselessly turning
      about on his shoulders on all sides, so that Foma was unable to see his
      face, and he was angry at him for this, and kept on pushing him aside,
      crying excitedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away! Where is your face? Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A deafening, drunken laughter smote the air about them, and choking with
      laughter, the son of the brandy-distiller roared to someone hoarsely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to me! A hundred roubles a month with board and lodging! Throw the
      paper to the dogs. I&rsquo;ll give you more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And everything rocked from side to side in rhythmic, wave-like movement.
      Now the people moved farther away from Foma, now they came nearer to him,
      the ceiling descended, the floor rose, and it seemed to Foma that he would
      soon be flattened and crushed. Then he began to feel that he was floating
      somewhere over an immensely wide and stormy river, and, staggering, he
      cried out in fright:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we floating? Where is the captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was answered by the loud, senseless laughter of the drunken crowd, and
      by the shrill, repulsive shout of the swarthy little man:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True! we are all without helm and sails. Where is the captain? What? Ha,
      ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma awakened from this nightmare in a small room with two windows, and
      the first thing his eyes fell upon was a withered tree. It stood near the
      window; its thick trunk, barkless, with a rotten heart, prevented the
      light from entering the room; the bent, black branches, devoid of leaves,
      stretched themselves mournfully and helplessly in the air, and shaking to
      and fro, they creaked softly, plaintively. A rain was falling; streams of
      water were beating against the window-panes, and one could hear how the
      water was falling to the ground from the roof, sobbing there. This sobbing
      sound was joined by another sound&mdash;a shrill, often interrupted, hasty
      scratching of a pen over paper, and then by a certain spasmodic grumbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he turned with difficulty his aching, heavy head on the pillow, Foma
      noticed a small, swarthy man, who sat by the table hastily scratching with
      his pen over the paper, shaking his round head approvingly, wagging it
      from side to side, shrugging his shoulders, and, with all his small body
      clothed in night garments only, constantly moving about in his chair, as
      though he were sitting on fire, and could not get up for some reason or
      other. His left hand, lean and thin, was now firmly rubbing his forehead,
      now making certain incomprehensible signs in the air; his bare feet
      scraped along the floor, a certain vein quivered on his neck, and even his
      ears were moving. When he turned toward Foma, Foma saw his thin lips
      whispering something, his sharp-pointed nose turned down to his thin
      moustache, which twitched upward each time the little man smiled. His face
      was yellow, bloated, wrinkled, and his black, vivacious small sparkling
      eyes did not seem to belong to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having grown tired of looking at him, Foma slowly began to examine the
      room with his eyes. On the large nails, driven into the walls, hung piles
      of newspapers, which made the walls look as though covered with swellings.
      The ceiling was pasted with paper which had been white once upon a time;
      now it was puffed up like bladders, torn here and there, peeled off and
      hanging in dirty scraps; clothing, boots, books, torn pieces of paper lay
      scattered on the floor. Altogether the room gave one the impression that
      it had been scalded with boiling water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man dropped the pen, bent over the table, drummed briskly on
      its edge with his fingers and began to sing softly in a faint voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the drum and fear not,&mdash;And kiss the sutler girl aloud&mdash;That&rsquo;s
      the sense of learning&mdash;And that&rsquo;s philosophy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma heaved a deed sigh and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have some seltzer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed the little man, and jumping up from his chair, appeared at
      the wide oilcloth-covered lounge, where Foma lay. &ldquo;How do you do, comrade!
      Seltzer? Of course! With cognac or plain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better with cognac,&rdquo; said Foma, shaking the lean, burning hand which was
      outstretched to him, and staring fixedly into the face of the little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yegorovna!&rdquo; cried the latter at the door, and turning to Foma, asked:
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you recognise me, Foma Ignatyevich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember something. It seems to me we had met somewhere before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That meeting lasted for four years, but that was long ago! Yozhov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, in astonishment, slightly rising from the
      lounge. &ldquo;Is it possible that it is you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are times, dear, when I don&rsquo;t believe it myself, but a real fact is
      something from which doubt jumps back as a rubber ball from iron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov&rsquo;s face was comically distorted, and for some reason or other his
      hands began to feel his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; drawled out Foma. &ldquo;But how old you have grown! Ah-ah! How
      old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you look as though you were fifty, lean, yellow. Life isn&rsquo;t sweet to
      you, it seems? And you are drinking, too, I see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma felt sorry to see his jolly and brisk schoolmate so worn out, and
      living in this dog-hole, which seemed to be swollen from burns. He looked
      at him, winked his eyes mournfully and saw that Yozhov&rsquo;s face was for ever
      twitching, and his small eyes were burning with irritation. Yozhov was
      trying to uncork the bottle of water, and thus occupied, was silent; he
      pressed the bottle between his knees and made vain efforts to take out the
      cork. And his impotence moved Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; life has sucked you dry. And you have studied. Even science seems to
      help man but little,&rdquo; said Gordyeeff plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink!&rdquo; said Yozhov, turning pale with fatigue, and handing him the
      glass. Then he wiped his forehead, seated himself on the lounge beside
      Foma, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave science alone! Science is a drink of the gods; but it has not yet
      fermented sufficiently, and, therefore is not fit for use, like vodka
      which has not yet been purified from empyreumatic oil. Science is not
      ready for man&rsquo;s happiness, my friend. And those living people that use it
      get nothing but headaches. Like those you and I have at present. Why do
      you drink so rashly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? What else am I to do?&rdquo; asked Foma, laughing. Yozhov looked at Foma
      searchingly with his eyes half closed, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Connecting your question with everything you jabbered last night, I feel
      within my troubled soul that you, too, my friend, do not amuse yourself
      because life is cheerful to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh!&rdquo; sighed Foma, heavily, rising from the lounge. &ldquo;What is my life? It
      is something meaningless. I live alone. I understand nothing. And yet
      there is something I long for. I yearn to spit on all and then disappear
      somewhere! I would like to run away from everything. I am so weary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting!&rdquo; said Yozhov, rubbing his hands and turning about in
      all directions. &ldquo;This is interesting, if it is true and deep, for it shows
      that the holy spirit of dissatisfaction with life has already penetrated
      into the bed chambers of the merchants, into the death chambers of souls
      drowned in fat cabbage soup, in lakes of tea and other liquids. Give me a
      circumstantial account of it. Then, my dear, I shall write a novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been told that you have already written something about me?&rdquo;
       inquired Foma, with curiosity, and once more attentively scrutinized his
      old friend unable to understand what so wretched a creature could write.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I have! Did you read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did not have the chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what have they told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you gave me a clever scolding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm! And doesn&rsquo;t it interest you to read it yourself?&rdquo; inquired Yozhov,
      scrutinizing Gordyeeff closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read it!&rdquo; Foma assured him, feeling embarrassed before Yozhov, and
      that Yozhov was offended by such regard for his writings. &ldquo;Indeed, it is
      interesting since it is about myself,&rdquo; he added, smiling kindheartedly at
      his comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      In saying this he was not at all interested, and he said it merely out of
      pity for Yozhov. There was quite another feeling in him; he wished to know
      what sort of a man Yozhov was, and why he had become so worn out. This
      meeting with Yozhov gave rise in him to a tranquil and kind feeling; it
      called forth recollections of his childhood, and these flashed now in his
      memory,&mdash;flashed like modest little lights, timidly shining at him
      from the distance of the past. Yozhov walked up to the table on which
      stood a boiling samovar, silently poured out two glasses of tea as strong
      as tar, and said to Foma:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and drink tea. And tell me about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to tell you. I have not seen anything in life. Mine is an
      empty life! You had better tell me about yourself. I am sure you know more
      than I do, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov became thoughtful, not ceasing to turn his whole body and to waggle
      his head. In thoughtfulness his face became motionless, all its wrinkles
      gathered near his eyes and seemed to surround them with rays, and because
      of this his eyes receded deeper under his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear, I have seen a thing or two, and I know a great deal,&rdquo; he
      began, with a shake of the head. &ldquo;And perhaps I know even more than it is
      necessary for me to know, and to know more than it is necessary is just as
      harmful to man as it is to be ignorant of what it is essential to know.
      Shall I tell you how I have lived? Very well; that is, I&rsquo;ll try. I have
      never told any one about myself, because I have never aroused interest in
      anyone. It is most offensive to live on earth without arousing people&rsquo;s
      interest in you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see by your face and by everything else that your life has not been
      a smooth one!&rdquo; said Foma, feeling pleased with the fact that, to all
      appearances, life was not sweet to his comrade as well. Yozhov drank his
      tea at one draught, thrust the glass on the saucer, placed his feet on the
      edge of the chair, and clasping his knees in his hands, rested his chin
      upon them. In this pose, small sized and flexible as rubber, he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The student Sachkov, my former teacher, who is now a doctor of medicine,
      a whist-player and a mean fellow all around, used to tell me whenever I
      knew my lesson well: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a fine fellow, Kolya! You are an able boy. We
      proletariats, plain and poor people, coming from the backyard of life, we
      must study and study, in order to come to the front, ahead of everybody.
      Russia is in need of wise and honest people. Try to be such, and you will
      be master of your fate and a useful member of society. On us commoners
      rest the best hopes of the country. We are destined to bring into it
      light, truth,&rsquo; and so on. I believed him, the brute. And since then about
      twenty years have elapsed. We proletariats have grown up, but have neither
      appropriated any wisdom, nor brought light into life. As before, Russia is
      still suffering from its chronic disease&mdash;a superabundance of
      rascals; while we, the proletariats, take pleasure in filling their dense
      throngs. My teacher, I repeat, is a lackey, a characterless and dumb
      creature, who must obey the orders of the mayor. While I am a clown in the
      employ of society. Fame pursues me here in town, dear. I walk along the
      street and I hear one driver say to another: &lsquo;There goes Yozhov! How
      cleverly he barks, the deuce take him!&rsquo; Yes! Even this cannot be so easily
      attained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov&rsquo;s face wrinkled into a bitter grimace, and he began to laugh,
      noiselessly, with his lips only. Foma did not understand his words, and,
      just to say something, he remarked at random:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t hit, then, what you aimed at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought I would grow up higher. And so I should! So I should, I
      say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He jumped up from his chair and began to run about in the room, exclaiming
      briskly in a shrill voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to preserve one&rsquo;s self pure for life and to be a free man in it, one
      must have vast powers! I had them. I had elasticity, cleverness. I have
      spent all these in order to learn something which is absolutely
      unnecessary to me now. I have wasted the whole of myself in order to
      preserve something within myself. Oh devil! I myself and many others with
      me, we have all robbed ourselves for the sake of saving up something for
      life. Just think of it: desiring to make of myself a valuable man, I have
      underrated my individuality in every way possible. In order to study, and
      not die of starvation, I have for six years in succession taught
      blockheads how to read and write, and had to bear a mass of abominations
      at the hands of various papas and mammas, who humiliated me without any
      constraint. Earning my bread and tea, I could not, I had not the time to
      earn my shoes, and I had to turn to charitable institutions with humble
      petitions for loans on the strength of my poverty. If the philanthropists
      could only reckon up how much of the spirit they kill in man while
      supporting the life of his body! If they only knew that each rouble they
      give for bread contains ninety-nine copecks&rsquo; worth of poison for the soul!
      If they could only burst from excess of their kindness and pride, which
      they draw from their holy activity! There is none on earth more disgusting
      and repulsive than he who gives alms, even as there is none more miserable
      than he who accepts it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov staggered about in the room like a drunken man, seized with
      madness, and the paper under his feet was rustling, tearing, flying in
      scraps. He gnashed his teeth, shook his head, his hands waved in the air
      like broken wings of a bird, and altogether it seemed as though he were
      being boiled in a kettle of hot water. Foma looked at him with a strange,
      mixed sensation; he pitied Yozhov, and at the same time he was pleased to
      see him suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not alone, he is suffering, too,&rdquo; thought Foma, as Yozhov spoke. And
      something clashed in Yozhov&rsquo;s throat, like broken glass, and creaked like
      an unoiled hinge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poisoned by the kindness of men, I was ruined through the fatal capacity
      of every poor fellow during the making of his career, through the capacity
      of being reconciled with little in the expectation of much. Oh! Do you
      know, more people perish through lack of proper self-appreciation than
      from consumption, and perhaps that is why the leaders of the masses serve
      as district inspectors!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take the district inspectors!&rdquo; said Foma, with a wave of the
      hand. &ldquo;Tell me about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About myself! I am here entire!&rdquo; exclaimed Yozhov, stopping short in the
      middle of the room, and striking his chest with his hands. &ldquo;I have already
      accomplished all I could accomplish. I have attained the rank of the
      public&rsquo;s entertainer&mdash;and that is all I can do! To know what should
      be done, and not to be able to do it, not to have the strength for your
      work&mdash;that is torture!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Wait awhile!&rdquo; said Foma, enthusiastically. &ldquo;Now tell me what
      one should do in order to live calmly; that is, in order to be satisfied
      with one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Foma these words sounded loud, but empty, and their sounds died away
      without stirring any emotion in his heart, without giving rise to a single
      thought in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must always be in love with something unattainable to you. A man
      grows in height by stretching himself upwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now that he had ceased speaking of himself, Yozhov began to talk more
      calmly, in a different voice. His voice was firm and resolute, and his
      face assumed an expression of importance and sternness. He stood in the
      centre of the room, his hand with outstretched fingers uplifted, and spoke
      as though he were reading:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men are base because they strive for satiety. The well-fed man is an
      animal because satiety is the self-contentedness of the body. And the
      self-contentedness of the spirit also turns man into animal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he started as though all his veins and muscles were suddenly
      strained, and again he began to run about the room in seething agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A self-contented man is the hardened swelling on the breast of society.
      He is my sworn enemy. He fills himself up with cheap truths, with gnawed
      morsels of musty wisdom, and he exists like a storeroom where a stingy
      housewife keeps all sorts of rubbish which is absolutely unnecessary to
      her, and worthless. If you touch such a man, if you open the door into
      him, the stench of decay will be breathed upon you, and a stream of some
      musty trash will be poured into the air you breathe. These unfortunate
      people call themselves men of firm character, men of principles and
      convictions. And no one cares to see that convictions are to them but the
      clothes with which they cover the beggarly nakedness of their souls. On
      the narrow brows of such people there always shines the inscription so
      familiar to all: calmness and confidence. What a false inscription! Just
      rub their foreheads with firm hand and then you will see the real
      sign-board, which reads: &lsquo;Narrow mindedness and weakness of soul!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma watched Yozhov bustling about the room, and thought mournfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom is he abusing? I can&rsquo;t understand; but I can see that he has been
      terribly wounded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many such people have I seen!&rdquo; exclaimed Yozhov, with wrath and
      terror. &ldquo;How these little retail shops have multiplied in life! In them
      you will find calico for shrouds, and tar, candy and borax for the
      extermination of cockroaches, but you will not find anything fresh, hot,
      wholesome! You come to them with an aching soul exhausted by loneliness;
      you come, thirsting to hear something that has life in it. And they offer
      to you some worm cud, ruminated book-thoughts, grown sour with age. And
      these dry, stale thoughts are always so poor that, in order to give them
      expression, it is necessary to use a vast number of high-sounding and
      empty words. When such a man speaks I say to myself: &lsquo;There goes a
      well-fed, but over-watered mare, all decorated with bells; she&rsquo;s carting a
      load of rubbish out of the town, and the miserable wretch is content with
      her fate.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are superfluous people, then,&rdquo; said Foma. Yozhov stopped short in
      front of him and said with a biting smile on his lips:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, they are not superfluous, oh no! They exist as an example, to show
      what man ought not to be. Speaking frankly, their proper place is the
      anatomical museums, where they preserve all sorts of monsters and various
      sickly deviations from the normal. In life there is nothing that is
      superfluous, dear. Even I am necessary! Only those people, in whose souls
      dwells a slavish cowardice before life, in whose bosoms there are enormous
      ulcers of the most abominable self-adoration, taking the places of their
      dead hearts&mdash;only those people are superfluous; but even they are
      necessary, if only for the sake of enabling me to pour my hatred upon
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All day long, until evening, Yozhov was excited, venting his blasphemy on
      men he hated, and his words, though their contents were obscure to Foma,
      infected him with their evil heat, and infecting called forth in him an
      eager desire for combat. At times there sprang up in him distrust of
      Yozhov, and in one of these moments he asked him plainly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! And can you speak like that in the face of men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do it at every convenient occasion. And every Sunday in the newspaper.
      I&rsquo;ll read some to you if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for Foma&rsquo;s reply, he tore down from the wall a few sheets
      of paper, and still continuing to run about the room, began to read to
      him. He roared, squeaked, laughed, showed his teeth and looked like an
      angry dog trying to break the chain in powerless rage. Not grasping the
      ideals in his friend&rsquo;s creations, Foma felt their daring audacity, their
      biting sarcasm, their passionate malice, and he was as well pleased with
      them as though he had been scourged with besoms in a hot bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clever!&rdquo; he exclaimed, catching some separate phrase. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cleverly
      aimed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every now and again there flashed before him the familiar names of
      merchants and well-known citizens, whom Yozhov had stung, now stoutly and
      sharply, now respectfully and with a fine needle-like sting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma&rsquo;s approbation, his eyes burning with satisfaction, and his excited
      face gave Yozhov still more inspiration, and he cried and roared ever
      louder and louder, now falling on the lounge from exhaustion, now jumping
      up again and rushing toward Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now, read about me!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, longing to hear it. Yozhov
      rummaged among a pile of papers, tore out one sheet, and holding it in
      both hands, stopped in front of Foma, with his legs straddled wide apart,
      while Foma leaned back in the broken-seated armchair and listened with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The notice about Foma started with a description of the spree on the
      rafts, and during the reading of the notice Foma felt that certain
      particular words stung him like mosquitoes. His face became more serious,
      and he bent his head in gloomy silence. And the mosquitoes went on
      multiplying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that&rsquo;s too much!&rdquo; said he, at length, confused and dissatisfied.
      &ldquo;Surely you cannot gain the favour of God merely because you know how to
      disgrace a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet! Wait awhile!&rdquo; said Yozhov, curtly, and went on reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having established in his article that the merchant rises beyond doubt
      above the representatives of other classes of society in the matter of
      nuisance and scandal-making, Yozhov asked: &ldquo;Why is this so?&rdquo; and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that this predilection for wild pranks comes from the lack
      of culture in so far as it is dependent upon the excess of energy and upon
      idleness. There cannot be any doubt that our merchant class, with but few
      exceptions, is the healthiest and, at the same time, most inactive class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, striking the table with his fist. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      true! I have the strength of a bull and do the work of a sparrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the merchant to spend his energy? He cannot spend much of it on
      the Exchange, so he squanders the excess of his muscular capital in
      drinking-bouts in kabaky; for he has no conception of other applications
      of his strength, which are more productive, more valuable to life. He is
      still a beast, and life has already become to him a cage, and it is too
      narrow for him with his splendid health and predilection for
      licentiousness. Hampered by culture he at once starts to lead a dissolute
      life. The debauch of a merchant is always the revolt of a captive beast.
      Of course this is bad. But, ah! it will be worse yet, when this beast, in
      addition to his strength, shall have gathered some sense and shall have
      disciplined it. Believe me, even then he will not cease to create
      scandals, but they will be historical events. Heaven deliver us from such
      events! For they will emanate from the merchant&rsquo;s thirst for power; their
      aim will be the omnipotence of one class, and the merchant will not be
      particular about the means toward the attainment of this aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you say, is it true?&rdquo; asked Yozhov, when he had finished
      reading the newspaper, and thrown it aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand the end,&rdquo; replied Foma. &ldquo;And as to strength, that is
      true! Where am I to make use of my strength since there is no demand for
      it! I ought to fight with robbers, or turn a robber myself. In general I
      ought to do something big. And that should be done not with the head, but
      with the arms and the breast. While here we have to go to the Exchange and
      try to aim well to make a rouble. What do we need it for? And what is it,
      anyway? Has life been arranged in this form forever? What sort of life is
      it, if everyone is grieved and finds it too narrow for him? Life ought to
      be according to the taste of man. If it is narrow for me, I must move it
      asunder that I may have more room. I must break it and reconstruct it. But
      nod? That&rsquo;s where the trouble lies! What ought to be done that life may be
      freer? That I do not understand, and that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; drawled out Yozhov. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ve gone! That, dear, is a
      good thing! Ah, you ought to study a little! How are you about books? Do
      you read any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t care for them. I haven&rsquo;t read any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just why you don&rsquo;t care for them.&rdquo; &ldquo;I am even afraid to read them.
      I know one&mdash;a certain girl&mdash;it&rsquo;s worse than drinking with her!
      And what sense is there in books? One man imagines something and prints
      it, and others read it. If it is interesting, it&rsquo;s all right. But learn
      from a book how to live!&mdash;that is something absurd. It was written by
      man, not by God, and what laws and examples can man establish for
      himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about the Gospels? Were they not written by men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those were apostles. Now there are none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, your refutation is sound! It is true, dear, there are no apostles.
      Only the Judases remained, and miserable ones at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma felt very well, for he saw that Yozhov was attentively listening to
      his words and seemed to be weighing each and every word he uttered.
      Meeting such bearing toward him for the first time in his life, Foma
      unburdened himself boldly and freely before his friend, caring nothing for
      the choice of words, and feeling that he would be understood because
      Yozhov wanted to understand him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a curious fellow!&rdquo; said Yozhov, about two days after their
      meeting. &ldquo;And though you speak with difficulty, one feels that there is a
      great deal in you&mdash;great daring of heart! If you only knew a little
      about the order of life! Then you would speak loud enough, I think. Yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you cannot wash yourself clean with words, nor can you then free
      yourself,&rdquo; remarked Foma, with a sigh. &ldquo;You have said something about
      people who pretend that they know everything, and can do everything. I
      also know such people. My godfather, for instance. It would be a good
      thing to set out against them, to convict them; they&rsquo;re a pretty dangerous
      set!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot imagine, Foma, how you will get along in life if you preserve
      within you that which you now have,&rdquo; said Yozhov, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard. I lack steadfastness. Of a sudden I could perhaps do
      something. I understand very well that life is difficult and narrow for
      every one of us. I know that my godfather sees that, too! But he profits
      by this narrowness. He feels well in it; he is sharp as a needle, and
      he&rsquo;ll make his way wherever he pleases. But I am a big, heavy man, that&rsquo;s
      why I am suffocating! That&rsquo;s why I live in fetters. I could free myself
      from everything with a single effort: just to move my body with all my
      strength, and then all the fetters will burst!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what then?&rdquo; asked Yozhov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then?&rdquo; Foma became pensive, and, after a moment&rsquo;s thought, waved his
      hand. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what will be then. I shall see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see!&rdquo; assented Yozhov.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was given to drink, this little man who was scalded by life. His day
      began thus: in the morning at his tea he looked over the local newspapers
      and drew from the news notices material for his feuilleton, which he wrote
      right then and there on the corner of the table. Then he ran to the
      editorial office, where he made up &ldquo;Provincial Pictures&rdquo; out of clippings
      from country newspapers. On Friday he had to write his Sunday feuilleton.
      For all they paid him a hundred and twenty-five roubles a month; he worked
      fast, and devoted all his leisure time to the &ldquo;survey and study of
      charitable institutions.&rdquo; Together with Foma he strolled about the clubs,
      hotels and taverns till late at night, drawing material everywhere for his
      articles, which he called &ldquo;brushes for the cleansing of the conscience of
      society.&rdquo; The censor he styled as &ldquo;superintendent of the diffusion of
      truth and righteousness in life,&rdquo; the newspaper he called &ldquo;the go-between,
      engaged in introducing the reader to dangerous ideas,&rdquo; and his own work,
      &ldquo;the sale of a soul in retail,&rdquo; and &ldquo;an inclination to audacity against
      holy institutions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma could hardly make out when Yozhov jested and when he was in earnest.
      He spoke of everything enthusiastically and passionately, he condemned
      everything harshly, and Foma liked it. But often, beginning to argue
      enthusiastically, he refuted and contradicted himself with equal
      enthusiasm or wound up his speech with some ridiculous turn. Then it
      appeared to Foma that that man loved nothing, that nothing was firmly
      rooted within him, that nothing guided him. Only when speaking of himself
      he talked in a rather peculiar voice, and the more impassioned he was in
      speaking of himself, the more merciless and enraged was he in reviling
      everything and everybody. And his relation toward Foma was dual; sometimes
      he gave him courage and spoke to him hotly, quivering in every limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead! Refute and overthrow everything you can! Push forward with all
      your might. There is nothing more valuable than man, know this! Cry at the
      top of your voice: &lsquo;Freedom! Freedom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Foma, warmed up by the glowing sparks of these words, began to
      dream of how he should start to refute and overthrow people who, for the
      sake of personal profit, do not want to broaden life, Yozhov would often
      cut him short:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop it! You cannot do anything! People like you are not needed. Your
      time, the time of the strong but not clever, is past, my dear! You are too
      late! There is no place for you in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? You are lying!&rdquo; cried Foma, irritated by contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what can you accomplish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I can kill you!&rdquo; said Foma, angrily, clenching his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you scarecrow!&rdquo; said Yozhov, convincingly and pitifully, with a shrug
      of the shoulder. &ldquo;Is there anything in that? Why, I am anyway half dead
      already from my wounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly inflamed with melancholy malice, he stretched himself and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My fate has wronged me. Why have I lowered myself, accepting the sops of
      the public? Why have I worked like a machine for twelve years in
      succession in order to study? Why have I swallowed for twelve long years
      in the Gymnasium and the University the dry and tedious trash and the
      contradictory nonsense which is absolutely useless to me? In order to
      become feuilleton-writer, to play the clown from day to day, entertaining
      the public and convincing myself that that is necessary and useful to
      them. Where is the powder of my youth? I have fired off all the charge of
      my soul at three copecks a shot. What faith have I acquired for myself?
      Only faith in the fact that everything in this life is worthless, that
      everything must be broken, destroyed. What do I love? Myself. And I feel
      that the object of my love does not deserve my love. What can I
      accomplish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He almost wept, and kept on scratching his breast and his neck with his
      thin, feeble hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sometimes he was seized with a flow of courage, and then he spoke in a
      different spirit:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh, no, my song is not yet sung to the end! My breast has imbibed
      something, and I&rsquo;ll hiss like a whip! Wait, I&rsquo;ll drop the newspaper, I&rsquo;ll
      start to do serious work, and write one small book, which I will entitle
      &lsquo;The Passing of the Soul&rsquo;; there is a prayer by that name, it is read for
      the dying. And before its death this society, cursed by the anathema of
      inward impotence, will receive my book like incense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Listening to each and every word of his, watching him and comparing his
      remarks, Foma saw that Yozhov was just as weak as he was, that he, too,
      had lost his way. But Yozhov&rsquo;s mood still infected Foma, his speeches
      enriched Foma&rsquo;s vocabulary, and sometimes he noticed with joyous delight
      how cleverly and forcibly he had himself expressed this or that idea. He
      often met in Yozhov&rsquo;s house certain peculiar people, who, it seemed to
      him, knew everything, understood everything, contradicted everything, and
      saw deceit and falsehood in everything. He watched them in silence,
      listened to their words; their audacity pleased him, but he was
      embarrassed and repelled by their condescending and haughty bearing toward
      him. And then he clearly saw that in Yozhov&rsquo;s room they were all cleverer
      and better than they were in the street and in the hotels. They held
      peculiar conversations, words and gestures for use in the room, and all
      this was changed outside the room, into the most commonplace and human.
      Sometimes, in the room, they all blazed up like a huge woodpile, and
      Yozhov was the brightest firebrand among them; but the light of this
      bonfire illuminated but faintly the obscurity of Foma Gordyeeff&rsquo;s soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Yozhov said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Today we will carouse! Our compositors have formed a union, and they are
      going to take all the work from the publisher on a contract. There will be
      some drinking on this account, and I am invited. It was I who advised them
      to do it. Let us go? You will give them a good treat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo; said Foma, to whom it was immaterial with whom he passed the
      time, which was a burden to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening of that day Foma and Yozhov sat in the company of
      rough-faced people, on the outskirts of a grove, outside the town. There
      were twelve compositors there, neatly dressed; they treated Yozhov simply,
      as a comrade, and this somewhat surprised and embarrassed Foma, in whose
      eyes Yozhov was after all something of a master or superior to them, while
      they were really only his servants. They did not seem to notice Gordyeeff,
      although, when Yozhov introduced Foma to them, they shook hands with him
      and said that they were glad to see him. He lay down under a hazel-bush,
      and watched them all, feeling himself a stranger in this company, and
      noticing that even Yozhov seemed to have got away from him deliberately,
      and was paying but little attention to him. He perceived something strange
      about Yozhov; the little feuilleton-writer seemed to imitate the tone and
      the speech of the compositors. He bustled about with them at the woodpile,
      uncorked bottles of beer, cursed, laughed loudly and tried his best to
      resemble them. He was even dressed more simply than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, brethren!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;I feel well with you! I&rsquo;m
      not a big bird, either. I am only the son of the courthouse guard, and
      noncommissioned officer, Matvey Yozhov!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does he say that?&rdquo; thought Foma. &ldquo;What difference does it make whose
      son a man is? A man is not respected on account of his father, but for his
      brains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sun was setting like a huge bonfire in the sky, tinting the clouds
      with hues of gold and of blood. Dampness and silence were breathed from
      the forest, while at its outskirts dark human figures bustled about
      noisily. One of them, short and lean, in a broad-brimmed straw hat, played
      the accordion; another one, with dark moustache and with his cap on the
      back of his head, sang an accompaniment softly. Two others tugged at a
      stick, testing their strength. Several busied themselves with the basket
      containing beer and provisions; a tall man with a grayish beard threw
      branches on the fire, which was enveloped in thick, whitish smoke. The
      damp branches, falling on the fire, crackled and rustled plaintively, and
      the accordion teasingly played a lively tune, while the falsetto of the
      singer reinforced and completed its loud tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from them all, on the brink of a small ravine, lay three young
      fellows, and before them stood Yozhov, who spoke in a ringing voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bear the sacred banner of labour. And I, like yourselves, am a
      private soldier in the same army. We all serve Her Majesty, the Press. And
      we must live in firm, solid friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Nikolay Matveyich!&rdquo; some one&rsquo;s thick voice interrupted him.
      &ldquo;And we want to ask you to use your influence with the publisher! Use your
      influence with him! Illness and drunkenness cannot be treated as one and
      the same thing. And, according to his system, it comes out thus; if one of
      us gets drunk he is fined to the amount of his day&rsquo;s earnings; if he takes
      sick the same is done. We ought to be permitted to present the doctor&rsquo;s
      certificate, in case of sickness, to make it certain; and he, to be just,
      ought to pay the substitute at least half the wages of the sick man.
      Otherwise, it is hard for us. What if three of us should suddenly be taken
      sick at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that is certainly reasonable,&rdquo; assented Yozhov. &ldquo;But, my friends,
      the principle of cooperation&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma ceased listening to the speech of his friend, for his attention was
      diverted by the conversation of others. Two men were talking; one was a
      tall consumptive, poorly dressed and angry-looking man; the other a
      fair-haired and fair-bearded young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; said the tall man sternly, and coughing, &ldquo;it is foolish!
      How can men like us marry? There will be children. Do we have enough to
      support them? The wife must be clothed&mdash;and then you can&rsquo;t tell what
      sort of a woman you may strike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a fine girl,&rdquo; said the fair-haired man, softly. &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s now
      that she is fine. A betrothed girl is one thing, a wife quite another. But
      that isn&rsquo;t the main point. You can try&mdash;perhaps she will really be
      good. But then you&rsquo;ll be short of means. You will kill yourself with work,
      and you will ruin her, too. Marriage is an impossible thing for us. Do you
      mean to say that we can support a family on such earnings? Here, you see,
      I have only been married four years, and my end is near. I have seen no
      joy&mdash;nothing but worry and care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He began to cough, coughed for a long time, with a groan, and when he had
      ceased, he said to his comrade in a choking voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop it, nothing will come of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His interlocutor bent his head mournfully, while Foma thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He speaks sensibly. It&rsquo;s evident he can reason well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lack of attention shown to Foma somewhat offended him and aroused in
      him at the same time a feeling of respect for these men with dark faces
      impregnated with lead-dust. Almost all of them were engaged in practical
      serious conversation, and their remarks were studded with certain peculiar
      words. None of them fawned upon him, none bothered him with love, with his
      back to the fire, and he saw before him a row of brightly illuminated,
      cheerful and simple faces. They were all excited from drinking, but were
      not yet intoxicated; they laughed, jested, tried to sing, drank, and ate
      cucumbers, white bread and sausages. All this had for Foma a particularly
      pleasant flavour; he grew bolder, seized by the general good feeling, and
      he longed to say something good to these people, to please them all in
      some way or other. Yozhov, sitting by his side, moved about on the ground,
      jostled him with his shoulder and, shaking his head, muttered something
      indistinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brethren!&rdquo; shouted the stout fellow. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s strike up the student song.
      Well, one, two!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Swift as the waves,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Someone roared in his bass voice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Are the days of our life.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends!&rdquo; said Yozhov, rising to his feet, a glass in his hand. He
      staggered, and leaned his other hand against Foma&rsquo;s head. The started song
      was broken off, and all turned their heads toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Working men! Permit me to say a few words, words from the heart. I am
      happy in your company! I feel well in your midst. That is because you are
      men of toil, men whose right to happiness is not subject to doubt,
      although it is not recognised. In your ennobling midst, Oh honest people,
      the lonely man, who is poisoned by life, breathes so easily, so freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov&rsquo;s voice quivered and quaked, and his head began to shake. Foma felt
      that something warm trickled down on his hand, and he looked up at the
      wrinkled face of Yozhov, who went on speaking, trembling in every limb:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not the only one. There are many like myself, intimidated by fate,
      broken and suffering. We are more unfortunate than you are, because we are
      weaker both in body and in soul, but we are stronger than you because we
      are armed with knowledge, which we have no opportunity to apply. We are
      gladly ready to come to you and resign ourselves to you and help you to
      live. There is nothing else for us to do! Without you we are without
      ground to stand on; without us, you are without light! Comrades! we were
      created by Fate itself to complete one another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he beg of them?&rdquo; thought Foma, listening to Yozhov&rsquo;s words with
      perplexity. And examining the faces of the compositors he saw that they
      also looked at the orator inquiringly, perplexedly, wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The future is yours, my friends!&rdquo; said Yozhov, faintly, shaking his head
      mournfully as though feeling sorry for the future, and yielding to these
      people against his will the predominance over it. &ldquo;The future belongs to
      the men of honest toil. You have a great task before you! You have to
      create a new culture, everything free, vital and bright! I, who am one of
      you in flesh and in spirit; who am the son of a soldier; I propose a toast
      to your future! Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov emptied his glass and sank heavily to the ground. The compositors
      unanimously took up his broken exclamation, and a powerful, thundering
      shout rolled through the air, causing the leaves on the trees to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s start a song now,&rdquo; proposed the stout fellow again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; chimed in two or three voices. A noisy dispute ensued as to
      what to sing. Yozhov listened to the noise, and, turning his head from one
      side to another, scrutinized them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brethren,&rdquo; Yozhov suddenly cried again, &ldquo;answer me. Say a few words in
      reply to my address of welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again&mdash;though not at once&mdash;all became silent, some looking at
      him with curiosity, others concealing a grin, still others with an
      expression of dissatisfaction plainly written on their faces. And he again
      rose from the ground and said, hotly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two of us here are cast away by life&mdash;I and that other one. We both
      desire the same regard for man and the happiness of feeling ourselves
      useful unto others. Comrades! And that big, stupid man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nikolay Matveyich, you had better not insult our guest!&rdquo; said someone in
      a deep, displeased voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s unnecessary,&rdquo; affirmed the stout fellow, who had invited Foma
      to the fireside. &ldquo;Why use offensive language?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A third voice rang out loudly and distinctly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have come together to enjoy ourselves&mdash;to take a rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fools!&rdquo; laughed Yozhov, faintly. &ldquo;Kind-hearted fools! Do you pity him?
      But do you know who he is? He is of those people who suck your blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do, Nikolay Matveyich!&rdquo; they cried to Yozhov. And all began to
      talk, paying no further attention to him. Foma felt so sorry for his
      friend that he did not even take offence. He saw that these people who
      defended him from Yozhov&rsquo;s attacks were now purposely ignoring the
      feuilleton-writer, and he understood that this would pain Yozhov if he
      were to notice it. And in order to take his friend away from possible
      unpleasantness, he nudged him in the side and said, with a kind-hearted
      laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you grumbler, shall we have a drink? Or is it time to go home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home? Where is the home of the man who has no place among men?&rdquo; asked
      Yozhov, and shouted again: &ldquo;Comrades!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unanswered, his shout was drowned in the general murmur. Then he drooped
      his head and said to Foma:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go. Though I don&rsquo;t mind sitting a little longer. It&rsquo;s interesting.
      They behave so nobly, the devils. By God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear it any longer. I feel cold. I am suffocating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma rose to his feet, removed his cap, and, bowing to the compositors,
      said loudly and cheerfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, gentlemen, for your hospitality! Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They immediately surrounded him and spoke to him persuasively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here! Where are you going? We might sing all together, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I must go, it would be disagreeable to my friend to go alone. I am
      going to escort him. I wish you a jolly feast!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you ought to wait a little!&rdquo; exclaimed the stout fellow, and then
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one will escort him home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The consumptive also remarked in a low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stay here. We&rsquo;ll escort him to town, and get him into a cab and&mdash;there
      you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma felt like staying there, and at the same time was afraid of
      something. While Yozhov rose to his feet, and, clutching at the sleeves of
      his overcoat, muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, the devil take them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Till we meet again, gentlemen! I&rsquo;m going!&rdquo; said Foma and departed amid
      exclamations of polite regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; Yozhov burst out laughing when he had got about twenty steps
      away from the fire. &ldquo;They see us off with sorrow, but they are glad that I
      am going away. I hindered them from turning into beasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, you did disturb them,&rdquo; said Foma. &ldquo;Why do you make such
      speeches? People have come out to enjoy themselves, and you obtrude
      yourself upon them. That bores them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet! You don&rsquo;t understand anything!&rdquo; cried Yozhov, harshly. &ldquo;You
      think I am drunk? It&rsquo;s my body that is intoxicated, but my soul is sober,
      it is always sober; it feels everything. Oh, how much meanness there is in
      the world, how much stupidity and wretchedness! And men&mdash;these
      stupid, miserable men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov paused, and, clasping his head with his hands, stood for awhile,
      staggering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; drawled out Foma. &ldquo;They are very much unlike one another. Now these
      men, how polite they are, like gentlemen. And they reason correctly, too,
      and all that sort of thing. They have common sense. Yet they are only
      labourers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness behind them the men struck up a powerful choral song.
      Inharmonious at first, it swelled and grew until it rolled in a huge,
      powerful wave through the invigorating nocturnal air, above the deserted
      field.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said Yozhov, sadly and softly, heaving a sigh. &ldquo;Whereby are we
      to live? Whereon fasten our soul? Who shall quench its thirsts for
      friendship brotherhood, love, for pure and sacred toil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These simple people,&rdquo; said Foma, slowly and pensively, without listening
      to his companion s words, absorbed as he was in his own thoughts, &ldquo;if one
      looks into these people, they&rsquo;re not so bad! It&rsquo;s even very&mdash;it is
      interesting. Peasants, labourers, to look at them plainly, they are just
      like horses. They carry burdens, they puff and blow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They carry our life on their backs,&rdquo; exclaimed Yozhov with irritation.
      &ldquo;They carry it like horses, submissively, stupidly. And this
      submissiveness of theirs is our misfortune, our curse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Foma, carried away by his own thought, argued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They carry burdens, they toil all their life long for mere trifles. And
      suddenly they say something that wouldn&rsquo;t come into your mind in a
      century. Evidently they feel. Yes, it is interesting to be with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Staggering, Yozhov walked in silence for a long time, and suddenly he
      waved his hand in the air and began to declaim in a dull, choking voice,
      which sounded as though it issued from his stomach:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life has cruelly deceived me, I have suffered so much pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These, dear boy, are my own verses,&rdquo; said he, stopping short and nodding
      his head mournfully. &ldquo;How do they run? I&rsquo;ve forgotten. There is something
      there about dreams, about sacred and pure longings, which are smothered
      within my breast by the vapour of life. Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The buried dreams within my breast Will never rise again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother! You are happier than I, because you are stupid. While I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rude!&rdquo; said Foma, irritated. &ldquo;You would better listen how they
      are singing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to listen to other people&rsquo;s songs,&rdquo; said Yozhov, with a
      shake of the head. &ldquo;I have my own, it is the song of a soul rent in pieces
      by life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he began to wail in a wild voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The buried dreams within my breast Will never rise again... How great
      their number is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a whole flower garden of bright, living dreams and hopes. They
      perished, withered and perished. Death is within my heart. The corpses of
      my dreams are rotting there. Oh! oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov burst into tears, sobbing like a woman. Foma pitied him, and felt
      uncomfortable with him. He jerked at his shoulder impatiently, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop crying! Come, how weak you are, brother!&rdquo; Clasping his head in his
      hand Yozhov straightened up his stooping frame, made an effort and started
      again mournfully and wildly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How great their number is! Their sepulchre how narrow! I clothed them all
      in shrouds of rhyme And many sad and solemn songs O&rsquo;er them I sang from
      time to time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; sighed Foma in despair. &ldquo;Stop that, for Christ&rsquo;s sake! By God,
      how sad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the distance the loud choral song was rolling through the darkness and
      the silence. Some one was whistling, keeping time to the refrain, and this
      shrill sound, which pierced the ear, ran ahead of the billow of powerful
      voices. Foma looked in that direction and saw the tall, black wall of
      forest, the bright fiery spot of the bonfire shining upon it, and the
      misty figures surrounding the fire. The wall of forest was like a breast,
      and the fire like a bloody wound in it. It seemed as though the breast was
      trembling, as the blood coursed down in burning streams. Embraced in dense
      gloom from all sides the people seemed on the background of the forest,
      like little children; they, too, seemed to burn, illuminated by the blaze
      of the bonfire. They waved their hands and sang their songs loudly,
      powerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Yozhov, standing beside Foma, spoke excitedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hard-hearted blockhead! Why do you repulse me? You ought to listen to
      the song of the dying soul, and weep over it, for, why was it wounded, why
      is it dying? Begone from me, begone! You think I am drunk? I am poisoned,
      begone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without lifting his eyes off the forest and the fire, so beautiful in the
      darkness, Foma made a few steps aside from Yozhov and said to him in a low
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t play the fool. Why do you abuse me at random?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to remain alone, and finish singing my song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Staggering, he, too, moved aside from Foma, and after a few seconds again
      exclaimed in a sobbing voice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;My song is done! And nevermore
     Shall I disturb their sleep of death,
     Oh Lord, Oh Lord, repose my soul!
     For it is hopeless in its wounds,
     Oh Lord, repose my soul.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Foma shuddered at the sounds of their gloomy wailing, and he hurried after
      Yozhov; but before he overtook him the little feuilleton-writer uttered a
      hysterical shriek, threw himself chest down upon the ground and burst out
      sobbing plaintively and softly, even as sickly children cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nikolay!&rdquo; said Foma, lifting him by the shoulders. &ldquo;Cease crying; what&rsquo;s
      the matter? Oh Lord. Nikolay! Enough, aren&rsquo;t you ashamed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Yozhov was not ashamed; he struggled on the ground, like a fish just
      taken from the water, and when Foma had lifted him to his feet, he pressed
      close to Foma&rsquo;s breast, clasping his sides with his thin arms, and kept on
      sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; said Foma, with his teeth tightly clenched.
      &ldquo;Enough, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And agitated by the suffering of the man who was wounded by the narrowness
      of life, filled with wrath on his account, he turned his face toward the
      gloom where the lights of the town were glimmering, and, in an outburst of
      wrathful grief, roared in a deep, loud voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A-a-ana-thema! Be cursed! Just wait. You, too, shall choke! Be cursed!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;LUBAVKA!&rdquo; said Mayakin one day when he came home from the Exchange,
      &ldquo;prepare yourself for this evening. I am going to bring you a bridegroom!
      Prepare a nice hearty little lunch for us. Put out on the table as much of
      our old silverware as possible, also bring out the fruit-vases, so that he
      is impressed by our table! Let him see that each and everything we have is
      a rarity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov was sitting by the window darning her father&rsquo;s socks, and her head
      was bent low over her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is all this for, papa?&rdquo; she asked, dissatisfied and offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, for sauce, for flavour. And then, it&rsquo;s in due order. For a girl is
      not a horse; you can&rsquo;t dispose of her without the harness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All aflush with offence, Lubov tossed her head nervously, and flinging her
      work aside, cast a glance at her father; and, taking up the socks again,
      she bent her head still lower over them. The old man paced the room to and
      fro, plucking at his fiery beard with anxiety; his eyes stared somewhere
      into the distance, and it was evident that he was all absorbed in some
      great complicated thought. The girl understood that he would not listen to
      her and would not care to comprehend how degrading his words were for her.
      Her romantic dreams of a husband-friend, an educated man, who would read
      with her wise books and help her to find herself in her confused desires,
      these dreams were stifled by her father&rsquo;s inflexible resolution to marry
      her to Smolin. They had been killed and had become decomposed, settling
      down as a bitter sediment in her soul. She had been accustomed to looking
      upon herself as better and higher than the average girl of the merchant
      class, than the empty and stupid girl who thinks of nothing but dresses,
      and who marries almost always according to the calculation of her parents,
      and but seldom in accordance with the free will of her heart. And now she
      herself is about to marry merely because it was time, and also because her
      father needed a son-in-law to succeed him in his business. And her father
      evidently thought that she, by herself, was hardly capable of attracting
      the attention of a man, and therefore adorned her with silver. Agitated,
      she worked nervously, pricked her fingers, broke needles, but maintained
      silence, being aware that whatever she should say would not reach her
      father&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the old man kept on pacing the room to and fro, now humming psalms
      softly, now impressively instructing his daughter how to behave with the
      bridegroom. And then he also counted something on his fingers, frowned and
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm! So! Try me, Oh Lord, and judge me. From the unjust and the false man,
      deliver me. Yes! Put on your mother&rsquo;s emeralds, Lubov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough, papa!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl, sadly. &ldquo;Pray, leave that alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you kick! Listen to what I&rsquo;m telling you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he was again absorbed in his calculations, snapping his green eyes and
      playing with his fingers in front of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That makes thirty-five percent. Mm! The fellow&rsquo;s a rogue. Send down thy
      light and thy truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; exclaimed Lubov, mournfully and with fright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;are you pleased with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With whom?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Smolin? Yes, he&rsquo;s a rogue, he&rsquo;s a clever fellow, a splendid merchant!
      Well, I&rsquo;m off now. So be on your guard, arm yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Lubov remained alone she flung her work aside and leaned against the
      back of her chair, closing her eyes tightly. Her hands firmly clasped
      together lay on her knees, and their fingers twitched. Filled with the
      bitterness of offended vanity, she felt an alarming fear of the future,
      and prayed in silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! Oh Lord! If he were only a kind man! Make him kind, sincere. Oh
      Lord! A strange man comes, examines you, and takes you unto himself for
      years, if you please him! How disgraceful that is, how terrible. Oh Lord,
      my God! If I could only run away! If I only had someone to advise me what
      to do! Who is he? How can I learn to know him? I cannot do anything! And I
      have thought, ah, how much I have thought! I have read. To what purpose
      have I read? Why should I know that it is possible to live otherwise, so
      as I cannot live? And it may be that were it not for the books my life
      would be easier, simpler. How painful all this is! What a wretched,
      unfortunate being I am! Alone. If Taras at least were here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the recollection of her brother she felt still more grieved, still more
      sorry for herself. She had written to Taras a long, exultant letter, in
      which she had spoken of her love for him, of her hope in him; imploring
      her brother to come as soon as possible to see his father, she had
      pictured to him plans of arranging to live together, assuring Taras that
      their father was extremely clever and understood everything; she told
      about his loneliness, had gone into ecstasy over his aptitude for life and
      had, at the same time, complained of his attitude toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two weeks she impatiently expected a reply, and when she had received
      and read it she burst out sobbing for joy and disenchantment. The answer
      was dry and short; in it Taras said that within a month he would be on the
      Volga on business and would not fail to call on his father, if the old man
      really had no objection to it. The letter was cold, like a block of ice;
      with tears in her eyes she perused it over and over again, rumpled it,
      creased it, but it did not turn warmer on this account, it only became
      wet. From the sheet of stiff note paper which was covered with writing in
      a large, firm hand, a wrinkled and suspiciously frowning face, thin and
      angular like that of her father, seemed to look at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Yakov Tarasovich the letter of his son made a different impression. On
      learning the contents of Taras&rsquo;s reply the old man started and hastily
      turned to his daughter with animation and with a peculiar smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me see it! Show it to me! He-he! Let&rsquo;s read how wise men write.
      Where are my spectacles? Mm! &lsquo;Dear sister!&rsquo; Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man became silent; he read to himself the message of his son, put
      it on the table, and, raising his eyebrows, silently paced the room to and
      fro, with an expression of amazement on his countenance. Then he read the
      letter once more, thoughtfully tapped the table with his fingers and
      spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That letter isn&rsquo;t bad&mdash;it is sound, without any unnecessary words.
      Well? Perhaps the man has really grown hardened in the cold. The cold is
      severe there. Let him come, we&rsquo;ll take a look at him. It&rsquo;s interesting.
      Yes. In the psalm of David concerning the mysteries of his son it is said:
      &lsquo;When Thou hast returned my enemy&rsquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;ve forgotten how it reads
      further. &lsquo;My enemy&rsquo;s weapons have weakened in the end, and his memory hath
      perished amid noise. Well, we&rsquo;ll talk it over with him without noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man tried to speak calmly and with a contemptuous smile, but the
      smile did not come; his wrinkles quivered irritably, and his small eyes
      had a particularly clear brilliancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write to him again, Lubovka. &lsquo;Come along!&rsquo; write him, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid to
      come!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov wrote Taras another letter, but this time it was shorter and more
      reserved, and now she awaited a reply from day to day, attempting to
      picture to herself what sort of man he must be, this mysterious brother of
      hers. Before she used to think of him with sinking heart, with that solemn
      respect with which believers think of martyrs, men of upright life; now
      she feared him, for he had acquired the right to be judge over men and
      life at the price of painful sufferings, at the cost of his youth, which
      was ruined in exile. On coming, he would ask her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are marrying of your own free will, for love, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What should she tell him? Would he forgive her faint-heartedness? And why
      does she marry? Can it really be possible that this is all she can do in
      order to change her life?
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloomy thoughts sprang up one after another in the head of the girl and
      confused and tortured her, impotent as she was to set up against them some
      definite, all-conquering desire. Though she was in an anxious and
      compressing her lips. Smolin rose from his chair, made a step toward her
      and bowed respectfully. She was rather pleased with this low and polite
      bow, also with the costly frock coat, which fitted Smolin&rsquo;s supple figure
      splendidly. He had changed but slightly&mdash;he was the same red-headed,
      closely-cropped, freckled youth; only his moustache had become long, and
      his eyes seemed to have grown larger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now he&rsquo;s changed, eh?&rdquo; exclaimed Mayakin to his daughter, pointing at the
      bridegroom. And Smolin shook hands with her, and smiling, said in a
      ringing baritone voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I venture to hope that you have not forgotten your old friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right! You can talk of this later,&rdquo; said the old man, scanning
      his daughter with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lubova, you can make your arrangements here, while we finish our little
      conversation. Well then, African Mitrich, explain yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will pardon me, Lubov Yakovlevna, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Smolin, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray do not stand upon ceremony,&rdquo; said Lubov. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s polite and clever,&rdquo;
       she remarked to herself; and, as she walked about in the room from the
      table to the sideboard, she began to listen attentively to Smolin&rsquo;s words.
      He spoke softly, confidently, with a simplicity, in which was felt
      condescendence toward the interlocutor. &ldquo;Well then, for four years I have
      carefully studied the condition of Russian leather in foreign markets.
      It&rsquo;s a sad and horrid condition! About thirty years ago our leather was
      considered there as the standard, while now the demand for it is
      constantly falling off, and, of course, the price goes hand in hand with
      it. And that is perfectly natural. Lacking the capital and knowledge all
      these small leather producers are not able to raise their product to the
      proper standard, and, at the same time, to reduce the price. Their goods
      are extremely bad and dear. And they are all to blame for having spoiled
      Russia&rsquo;s reputation as manufacturer of the best leather. In general, the
      petty producer, lacking the technical knowledge and capital, is
      consequently placed in a position where he is unable to improve his
      products in proportion to the development of the technical side. Such a
      producer is a misfortune for the country, the parasite of her commerce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; bellowed the old man, looking at his guest with one eye, and
      watching his daughter with the other. &ldquo;So that now your intention is to
      build such a great factory that all the others will go to the dogs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Smolin, warding off the old man&rsquo;s words with an easy
      wave of the hand. &ldquo;Why wrong others? What right have I to do so? My aim is
      to raise the importance and price of Russian leather abroad, and so
      equipped with the knowledge as to the manufacture, I am building a model
      factory, and fill the markets with model goods. The commercial honour of
      the country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it require much capital, did you say?&rdquo; asked Mayakin, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About three hundred thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father won&rsquo;t give me such a dowry,&rdquo; thought Lubov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My factory will also turn out leather goods, such as trunks, foot-wear,
      harnesses, straps and so forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of what per cent, are you dreaming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not dreaming, I am calculating with all the exactness possible under
      conditions in Russia,&rdquo; said Smolin, impressively. &ldquo;The manufacturer should
      be as strictly practical as the mechanic who is creating a machine. The
      friction of the tiniest screw must be taken into consideration, if you
      wish to do a serious thing seriously. I can let you read a little note
      which I have drawn up, based upon my personal study of cattle-breeding and
      of the consumption of meat in Russia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; laughed Mayakin. &ldquo;Bring me that note, it&rsquo;s interesting! It
      seems you did not spend your time for nothing in Western Europe. And now,
      let&rsquo;s eat something, after the Russian fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you passing the time, Lubov Yakovlevna?&rdquo; asked Smolin, arming
      himself with knife and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is rather lonesome here with me,&rdquo; replied Mayakin for his daughter.
      &ldquo;My housekeeper, all the household is on her shoulders, so she has no time
      to amuse herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no place, I must add,&rdquo; said Lubov. &ldquo;I am not fond of the balls and
      entertainments given by the merchants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the theatre?&rdquo; asked Smolin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seldom go there. I have no one to go with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The theatre!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man. &ldquo;Tell me, pray, why has it become
      the fashion then to represent the merchant as a savage idiot? It is very
      amusing, but it is incomprehensible, because it is false! Am I a fool, if
      I am master in the City Council, master in commerce, and also owner of
      that same theatre? You look at the merchant on the stage and you see&mdash;he
      isn&rsquo;t life-life! Of course, when they present something historical, such
      as: &lsquo;Life for the Czar,&rsquo; with song and dance, or &lsquo;Hamlet,&rsquo; &lsquo;The
      Sorceress,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Vasilisa,&rsquo; truthful reproduction is not required, because
      they&rsquo;re matters of the past and don&rsquo;t concern us. Whether true or not, it
      matters little so long as they&rsquo;re good, but when you represent modern
      times, then don&rsquo;t lie! And show the man as he really is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smolin listened to the old man&rsquo;s words with a covetous smile on his lips,
      and cast at Lubov glances which seemed to invite her to refute her father.
      Somewhat embarrassed, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, papa, the majority of the merchant class is uneducated and
      savage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; remarked Smolin with regret, nodding his head affirmatively, &ldquo;that
      is the sad truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take Foma, for instance,&rdquo; went on the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Mayakin. &ldquo;Well, you are young folks, you can have books in
      your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you not take interest in any of the societies?&rdquo; Smolin asked
      Lubov. &ldquo;You have so many different societies here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lubov with a sigh, &ldquo;but I live rather apart from everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Housekeeping!&rdquo; interposed the father. &ldquo;We have here such a store of
      different things, everything has to be kept clean, in order, and complete
      as to number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a self-satisfied air he nodded first at the table, which was set with
      brilliant crystal and silverware, and then at the sideboard, whose shelves
      were fairly breaking under the weight of the articles, and which reminded
      one of the display in a store window. Smolin noted all these and an
      ironical smile began to play upon his lips. Then he glanced at Lubov&rsquo;s
      face: in his look she caught something friendly, sympathetic to her. A
      faint flush covered her cheeks, and she said to herself with timid joy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light of the heavy bronze lamp now seemed to flash more brilliantly on
      the sides of the crystal vases, and it became brighter in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like our dear old town!&rdquo; said Smolin, looking at the girl with a kindly
      smile, &ldquo;it is so beautiful, so vigorous; there is cheerfulness about it
      that inspires one to work. Its very picturesqueness is somewhat
      stimulating. In it one feels like leading a dashing life. One feels like
      working much and seriously. And then, it is an intelligent town. Just see
      what a practical newspaper is published here. By the way, we intend to
      purchase it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom do you mean by You?&rdquo; asked Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Urvantzov, Shchukin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s praiseworthy!&rdquo; said the old man, rapping the table with his hand.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very practical! It is time to stop their mouths, it was high time
      long ago! Particularly that Yozhov; he&rsquo;s like a sharp-toothed saw. Just
      put the thumb-screw on him! And do it well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smolin again cast at Lubov a smiling glance, and her heart trembled with
      joy once more. With flushing face she said to her father, inwardly
      addressing herself to the bridegroom:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as I can understand, African Dmitreivich, he wishes to buy the
      newspaper not at all for the sake of stopping its mouth as you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then can be done with it?&rdquo; asked the old man, shrugging his
      shoulders. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in it but empty talk and agitation. Of course,
      if the practical people, the merchants themselves, take to writing for it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The publication of a newspaper,&rdquo; began Smolin, instructively,
      interrupting the old man, &ldquo;looked at merely from the commercial point of
      view, may be a very profitable enterprise. But aside from this, a
      newspaper has another more important aim&mdash;that is, to protect the
      right of the individual and the interests of industry and commerce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I say, if the merchant himself will manage the
      newspaper, then it will be useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, papa,&rdquo; said Lubov.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to feel the need of expressing herself before Smolin; she wanted
      to assure him that she understood the meaning of his words, that she was
      not an ordinary merchant-daughter, interested in dresses and balls only.
      Smolin pleased her. This was the first time she had seen a merchant who
      had lived abroad for a long time, who reasoned so impressively, who bore
      himself so properly, who was so well dressed, and who spoke to her father,
      the cleverest man in town, with the condescending tone of an adult towards
      a minor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the wedding I&rsquo;ll persuade him to take me abroad,&rdquo; thought Lubov,
      suddenly, and, confused at this thought she forgot what she was about to
      say to her father. Blushing deeply, she was silent for a few seconds,
      seized with fear lest Smolin might interpret this silence in a way
      unflattering to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On account of your conversation, you have forgotten to offer some wine to
      our guest,&rdquo; she said at last, after a few seconds of painful silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your business. You are hostess,&rdquo; retorted the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t disturb yourself!&rdquo; exclaimed Smolin, with animation. &ldquo;I hardly
      drink at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; asked Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you! Sometimes I drink a wine glass or two in case of fatigue or
      illness. But to drink wine for pleasure&rsquo;s sake is incomprehensible to me.
      There are other pleasures more worthy of a man of culture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean ladies, I suppose?&rdquo; asked the old man with a wink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smolin&rsquo;s cheeks and neck became red with the colour which leaped to his
      face. With apologetic eyes he glanced at Lubov, and said to her father
      drily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the theatre, books, music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov became radiant with joy at his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man looked askance at the worthy young man, smiled keenly and
      suddenly blurted out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, life is going onward! Formerly the dog used to relish a crust, now
      the pug dog finds the cream too thin; pardon me for my sour remark, but it
      is very much to the point. It does not exactly refer to yourself, but in
      general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov turned pale and looked at Smolin with fright. He was calm,
      scrutinising an ancient salt box, decorated with enamel; he twisted his
      moustache and looked as though he had not heard the old man&rsquo;s words. But
      his eyes grew darker, and his lips were compressed very tightly, and his
      clean-shaven chin obstinately projected forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, my future leading manufacturer,&rdquo; said Mayakin, as though nothing
      had happened, &ldquo;three hundred thousand roubles, and your business will
      flash up like a fire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And within a year and a half I shall send out the first lot of goods,
      which will be eagerly sought for,&rdquo; said Smolin, simply, with unshakable
      confidence, and he eyed the old man with a cold and firm look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it; the firm of Smolin and Mayakin, and that&rsquo;s all? So. Only it
      seems rather late for me to start a new business, doesn&rsquo;t it? I presume
      the grave has long been prepared for me; what do you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of an answer Smolin burst into a rich, but indifferent and cold
      laughter, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man shuddered at his laughter, and started back with fright, with
      a scarcely perceptible movement of his body. After Smolin&rsquo;s words all
      three maintained silence for about a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mayakin, without lifting his head, which was bent low. &ldquo;It is
      necessary to think of that. I must think of it.&rdquo; Then, raising his head,
      he closely scrutinised his daughter and the bridegroom, and, rising from
      his chair, he said sternly and brusquely: &ldquo;I am going away for awhile to
      my little cabinet. You surely won&rsquo;t feel lonesome without me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he went out with bent back and drooping head, heavily scraping with
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young people, thus left alone, exchanged a few empty phrases, and,
      evidently conscious that these only helped to remove them further from
      each other, they maintained a painful, awkward and expectant silence.
      Taking an orange, Lubov began to peel it with exaggerated attention, while
      Smolin, lowering his eyes, examined his moustaches, which he carefully
      stroked with his left hand, toyed with a knife and suddenly asked the girl
      in a lowered voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me for my indiscretion. It is evidently really difficult for you,
      Lubov Yakovlevna, to live with your father. He&rsquo;s a man with old-fashioned
      views and, pardon me, he&rsquo;s rather hard-hearted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov shuddered, and, casting at the red-headed man a grateful look, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t easy, but I have grown accustomed to it. He also has his good
      qualities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, undoubtedly! But to you who are so young, beautiful and educated, to
      you with your views... You see, I have heard something about you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled so kindly and sympathetically, and his voice was so soft, a
      breath of soul-cheering warmth filled the room. And in the heart of the
      girl there blazed up more and more brightly the timid hope of finding
      happiness, of being freed from the close captivity of solitude.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <p>
      A DENSE, grayish fog lay over the river, and a steamer, now and then
      uttering a dull whistle, was slowly forging up against the current. Damp
      and cold clouds, of a monotone pallor, enveloped the steamer from all
      sides and drowned all sounds, dissolving them in their troubled dampness.
      The brazen roaring of the signals came out in a muffled, melancholy drone,
      and was oddly brief as it burst forth from the whistle. The sound seemed
      to find no place for itself in the air, which was soaked with heavy
      dampness, and fell downward, wet and choked. And the splashing of the
      steamer&rsquo;s wheels sounded so fantastically dull that it seemed as though it
      were not begotten near by, at the sides of the vessel, but somewhere in
      the depth, on the dark bottom of the river. From the steamer one could see
      neither the water, nor the shore, nor the sky; a leaden-gray gloominess
      enwrapped it on all sides; devoid of shadings, painfully monotonous, the
      gloominess was motionless, it oppressed the steamer with immeasurable
      weight, slackened its movements and seemed as though preparing itself to
      swallow it even as it was swallowing the sounds. In spite of the dull
      blows of the paddles upon the water and the measured shaking of the body
      of the vessel, it seemed that the steamer was painfully struggling on one
      spot, suffocating in agony, hissing like a fairy tale monster breathing
      his last, howling in the pangs of death, howling with pain, and in the
      fear of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifeless were the steamer lights. About the lantern on the mast a yellow
      motionless spot had formed; devoid of lustre, it hung in the fog over the
      steamer, illuminating nothing save the gray mist. The red starboard light
      looked like a huge eye crushed out by some one&rsquo;s cruel fist, blinded,
      overflowing with blood. Pale rays of light fell from the steamer&rsquo;s windows
      into the fog, and only tinted its cold, cheerless dominion over the
      vessel, which was pressed on all sides by the motionless mass of stifling
      dampness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smoke from the funnel fell downwards, and, together with fragments of
      the fog, penetrated into all the cracks of the deck, where the third-class
      passengers were silently muffling themselves in their rags, and forming
      groups, like sheep. From near the machinery were wafted deep, strained
      groans, the jingling of bells, the dull sounds of orders and the abrupt
      words of the machinist:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;slow! Yes&mdash;half speed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the stern, in a corner, blocked up by barrels of salted fish, a group
      of people was assembled, illuminated by a small electric lamp. Those were
      sedate, neatly and warmly clad peasants. One of them lay on a bench, face
      down; another sat at his feet, still another stood, leaning his back
      against a barrel, while two others seated themselves flat on the deck.
      Their faces, pensive and attentive, were turned toward a round-shouldered
      man in a short cassock, turned yellow, and a torn fur cap. That man sat on
      some boxes with his back bent, and staring at his feet, spoke in a low,
      confident voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will come an end to the long forbearance of the Lord, and then His
      wrath will burst forth upon men. We are like worms before Him, and how are
      we then to ward off His wrath, with what wailing shall we appeal to His
      mercy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oppressed by his gloominess, Foma had come down on the deck from his
      cabin, and, for some time, had been standing in the shadow of some wares
      covered with tarpaulin, and listened to the admonitive and gentle voice of
      the preacher. Pacing the deck he had chanced upon this group, and
      attracted by the figure of the pilgrim, had paused near it. There was
      something familiar to him in that large, strong body, in that stern, dark
      face, in those large, calm eyes. The curly, grayish hair, falling from
      under the skull-cap, the unkempt bushy beard, which fell apart in thick
      locks, the long, hooked nose, the sharp-pointed ears, the thick lips&mdash;Foma
      had seen all these before, but could not recall when and where.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we are very much in arrears before the Lord!&rdquo; remarked one of the
      peasants, heaving a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must pray,&rdquo; whispered the peasant who lay on the bench, in a scarcely
      audible voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you scrape your sinful wretchedness off your soul with words of
      prayer?&rdquo; exclaimed someone loudly, almost with despair in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one of those that formed the group around the pilgrim turned at this
      voice, only their heads sank lower on their breasts, and for a long time
      these people sat motionless and speechless:
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim measured his audience with a serious and meditative glance of
      his blue eyes, and said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ephraim the Syrian said: &lsquo;Make thy soul the central point of thy thoughts
      and strengthen thyself with thy desire to be free from sin.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again he lowered his head, slowly fingering the beads of the rosary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means we must think,&rdquo; said one of the peasants; &ldquo;but when has a man
      time to think during his life on earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confusion is all around us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must flee to the desert,&rdquo; said the peasant who lay on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not everybody can afford it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The peasants spoke, and became silent again. A shrill whistle resounded, a
      little bell began to jingle at the machine. Someone&rsquo;s loud exclamation
      rang out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, there! To the water-measuring poles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord! Oh Queen of Heaven!&rdquo;&mdash;a deep sigh was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a dull, half-choked voice shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine! nine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fragments of the fog burst forth upon the deck and floated over it like
      cold, gray smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, kind people, give ear unto the words of King David,&rdquo; said the
      pilgrim, and shaking his head, began to read distinctly: &ldquo;&lsquo;Lead me, Oh
      Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight
      before my face. For there is no faithfulness in their mouths; their inward
      part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter
      with their tongue. Destroy thou them, Oh God; let them fall by their own
      counsels.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight! seven!&rdquo; Like moans these exclamations resounded in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer began to hiss angrily, and slackened its speed. The noise of
      the hissing of the steam deafened the pilgrim&rsquo;s words, and Foma saw only
      the movement of his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get off!&rdquo; a loud, angry shout was heard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my place!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you have yours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rap you on the jaw; then you&rsquo;ll find your place. What a lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An uproar ensued. The peasants who were listening to the pilgrim turned
      their heads toward the direction where the row was going on, and the
      pilgrim heaved a sigh and became silent. Near the machine a loud and
      lively dispute blazed up as though dry branches, thrown upon a dying
      bonfire, had caught the flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it to you, devils! Get away, both of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them away to the captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! That&rsquo;s a fine settlement for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a good rap he gave him on the neck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sailors are a clever lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight! nine!&rdquo; shouted the man with the measuring pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, increase speed!&rdquo; came the loud exclamation of the engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swaying because of the motion of the steamer, Foma stood leaning against
      the tarpaulin, and attentively listened to each and every sound about him.
      And everything was blended into one picture, which was familiar to him.
      Through fog and uncertainty, surrounded on all sides by gloom impenetrable
      to the eye, life of man is moving somewhere slowly and heavily. And men
      are grieved over their sins, they sigh heavily, and then fight for a warm
      place, and asking each other for the sake of possessing the place, they
      also receive blows from those who strive for order in life. They timidly
      search for a free road toward the goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine! eight!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wailing cry is softly wafted over the vessel. &ldquo;And the holy prayer of
      the pilgrim is deafened by the tumult of life. And there is no relief from
      sorrow, there is no joy for him who reflects on his fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma felt like speaking to this pilgrim, in whose softly uttered words
      there rang sincere fear of God, and all manner of fear for men before His
      countenance. The kind, admonitive voice of the pilgrim possessed a
      peculiar power, which compelled Foma to listen to its deep tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to ask him where he lives,&rdquo; thought Foma, fixedly scrutinizing
      the huge stooping figure. &ldquo;And where have I seen him before? Or does he
      resemble some acquaintance of mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it somehow struck Foma with particular vividness that the humble
      preacher before him was no other than the son of old Anany Shchurov.
      Stunned by this conjecture, he walked up to the pilgrim and seating
      himself by his side, inquired freely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you from Irgiz, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim raised his head, turned his face toward Foma slowly and
      heavily, scrutinized him and said in a calm and gentle voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on the Irgiz, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a native of that place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you now coming from there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am coming from Saint Stephen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The conversation broke off. Foma lacked the courage to ask the pilgrim
      whether he was not Shchurov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be late on account of the fog,&rdquo; said some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we help being late!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All were silent, looking at Foma. Young, handsome, neatly and richly
      dressed, he aroused the curiosity of the bystanders by his sudden
      appearance among them; he was conscious of this curiosity, he understood
      that they were all waiting for his words, that they wanted to understand
      why he had come to them, and all this confused and angered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to me that I&rsquo;ve met you before somewhere, father,&rdquo; said he at
      length.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim replied, without looking at him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like to speak to you,&rdquo; announced Foma, timidly, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, speak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my cabin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim looked into Foma&rsquo;s face, and, after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
      assented:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On leaving, Foma felt the looks of the peasants on his back, and now he
      was pleased to know that they were interested in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cabin he asked gently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you perhaps eat something? Tell me. I will order it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God forbid. What do you wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This man, dirty and ragged, in a cassock turned red with age, and covered
      with patches, surveyed the cabin with a squeamish look, and when he seated
      himself on the plush-covered lounge, he turned the skirt of the cassock as
      though afraid to soil it by the plush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name, father?&rdquo; asked Foma, noticing the expression of
      squeamishness on the pilgrim&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miron.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Mikhail?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Mikhail?&rdquo; asked the pilgrim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was in our town the son of a certain merchant Shchurov, he also
      went off to the Irgiz. And his name was Mikhail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma spoke and fixedly looked at Father Miron; but the latter was as calm
      as a deaf-mute&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never met such a man. I don&rsquo;t remember, I never met him,&rdquo; said he,
      thoughtfully. &ldquo;So you wished to inquire about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never met Mikhail Shchurov. Well, pardon me for Christ&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; and
      rising from the lounge, the pilgrim bowed to Foma and went toward the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wait awhile, sit down, let&rsquo;s talk a little!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, rushing
      at him uneasily. The pilgrim looked at him searchingly and sank down on
      the lounge. From the distance came a dull sound, like a deep groan, and
      immediately after it the signal whistle of the steamer drawled out as in a
      frightened manner over Foma&rsquo;s and his guest&rsquo;s heads. From the distance
      came a more distant reply, and the whistle overhead again gave out abrupt,
      timorous sounds. Foma opened the window. Through the fog, not far from
      their steamer, something was moving along with deep noise; specks of
      fantastic lights floated by, the fog was agitated and again sank into dead
      immobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, shutting the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to be afraid of?&rdquo; asked the pilgrim. &ldquo;You see! It is
      neither day nor night, neither darkness nor light! We can see nothing, we
      are sailing we know not whither, we are straying on the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have inward fire within you, have light within your soul, and you shall
      see everything,&rdquo; said the pilgrim, sternly and instructively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma was displeased with these cold words and looked at the pilgrim
      askance. The latter sat with drooping head, motionless, as though
      petrified in thought and prayer. The beads of his rosary were softly
      rustling in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim&rsquo;s attitude gave birth to easy courage in Foma&rsquo;s breast, and he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Father Miron, is it good to live, having full freedom, without
      work, without relatives, a wanderer, like yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Miron raised his head and softly burst into the caressing laughter
      of a child. All his face, tanned from wind and sunburn, brightened up with
      inward joy, was radiant with tranquil joy; he touched Foma&rsquo;s knee with his
      hand and said in a sincere tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cast aside from you all that is worldly, for there is no sweetness in it.
      I am telling you the right word&mdash;turn away from evil. Do you remember
      it is said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor
      standeth in the way of sinners.&rsquo; Turn away, refresh your soul with
      solitude and fill yourself with the thought of God. For only by the
      thought of Him can man save his soul from profanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t the thing!&rdquo; said Foma. &ldquo;I have no need of working out my
      salvation. Have I sinned so much? Look at others. What I would like is to
      comprehend things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will comprehend if you turn away from the world. Go forth upon
      the free road, on the fields, on the steppes, on the plains, on the
      mountains. Go forth and look at the world from afar, from your freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; cried Foma. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I think. One can see better
      from the side!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Miron, paying no attention to his words, spoke softly, as though of
      some great mystery, known only to him, the pilgrim:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thick slumbering forests around you will start to rustle in sweet
      voices about the wisdom of the Lord; God&rsquo;s little birds will sing before
      you of His holy glory, and the grasses of the steppe will burn incense to
      the Holy Virgin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim&rsquo;s voice now rose and quivered from excess of emotion, now sank
      to a mysterious whisper. He seemed as though grown younger; his eyes
      beamed so confidently and clearly, and all his face was radiant with the
      happy smile of a man who has found expression for his joy and was
      delighted while he poured it forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heart of God throbs in each and every blade of grass; each and every
      insect of the air and of the earth, breathes His holy spirit. God, the
      Lord, Jesus Christ, lives everywhere! What beauty there is on earth, in
      the fields and in the forests! Have you ever been on the Kerzhenz? An
      incomparable silence reigns there supreme, the trees, the grass there are
      like those of paradise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma listened, and his imagination, captivated by the quiet, charming
      narrative, pictured to him those wide fields and dense forests, full of
      beauty and soul-pacifying silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look at the sky, as you rest somewhere under a little bush, and the
      sky seems to descend upon you as though longing to embrace you. Your soul
      is warm, filled with tranquil joy, you desire nothing, you envy nothing.
      And it actually seems to you that there is no one on earth save you and
      God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pilgrim spoke, and his voice and sing-song speech reminded Foma of the
      wonderful fairy-tales of Aunt Anfisa. He felt as though, after a long
      journey on a hot day, he drank the clear, cold water of a forest brook,
      water that had the fragrance of the grasses and the flowers it has bathed.
      Even wider and wider grew the pictures as they unfolded upon him; here is
      a path through the thick, slumbering forest; the fine sunbeams penetrate
      through the branches of the trees, and quiver in the air and under the
      feet of the wanderer. There is a savoury odour of fungi and decaying
      foliage; the honeyed fragrance of the flowers, the intense odour of the
      pine-tree invisibly rise in the air and penetrate the breast in a warm,
      rich stream. All is silence: only the birds are singing, and the silence
      is so wonderful that it seems as though even the birds were singing in
      your breast. You go, without haste, and your life goes on like a dream.
      While here everything is enveloped in a gray, dead fog, and we are
      foolishly struggling about in it, yearning for freedom and light. There
      below they have started to sing something in scarcely audible voices; it
      was half song, half prayer. Again someone is shouting, scolding. And still
      they seek the way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven and a half. Seven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have no care,&rdquo; spoke the pilgrim, and his voice murmured like a
      brook. &ldquo;Anybody will give you a crust of bread; and what else do you need
      in your freedom? In the world, cares fall upon the soul like fetters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak well,&rdquo; said Foma with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear brother!&rdquo; exclaimed the pilgrim, softly, moving still closer
      toward him. &ldquo;Since the soul has awakened, since it yearns toward freedom,
      do not lull it to sleep by force; hearken to its voice. The world with its
      charms has no beauty and holiness whatever, wherefore, then, obey its
      laws? In John Chrysostom it is said: &lsquo;The real shechinah is man!&rsquo; 
      Shechinah is a Hebrew word and it means the holy of holies. Consequently&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A prolonged shrill sound of the whistle drowned his voice. He listened,
      rose quickly from the lounge and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are nearing the harbour. That&rsquo;s what the whistle meant. I must be off!
      Well, goodbye, brother! May God give you strength and firmness to act
      according to the will of your soul! Goodbye, my dear boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a low bow to Foma. There was something feminine, caressing and
      soft in his farewell words and bow. Foma also bowed low to him, bowed and
      remained as though petrified, standing with drooping head, his hand
      leaning against the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to see me when you are in town,&rdquo; he asked the pilgrim, who was
      hastily turning the handle of the cabin door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will! I will come! Goodbye! Christ save you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the steamer&rsquo;s side touched the wharf Foma came out on the deck and
      began to look downward into the fog. From the steamer people were walking
      down the gang-planks, but Foma could not discern the pilgrim among those
      dark figures enveloped in the dense gloom. All those that left the steamer
      looked equally indistinct, and they all quickly disappeared from sight, as
      though they had melted in the gray dampness. One could see neither the
      shore nor anything else solid; the landing bridge rocked from the
      commotion caused by the steamer; above it the yellow spot of the lantern
      was swaying; the noise of the footsteps and the bustle of the people were
      dull.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer put off and slowly moved along into the clouds. The pilgrim,
      the harbour, the turmoil of people&rsquo;s voices&mdash;all suddenly disappeared
      like a dream, and again there remained only the dense gloom and the
      steamer heavily turning about in it. Foma stared before him into the dead
      sea of fog and thought of the blue, cloudless and caressingly warm sky&mdash;where
      was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day, about noon, he sat In Yozhov&rsquo;s small room and listened to
      the local news from the mouth of his friend. Yozhov had climbed on the
      table, which was piled with newspapers, and, swinging his feet, narrated:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The election campaign has begun. The merchants are putting your godfather
      up as mayor&mdash;that old devil! Like the devil, he is immortal, although
      he must be upwards of a hundred and fifty years old already. He marries
      his daughter to Smolin. You remember that red-headed fellow. They say that
      he is a decent man, but nowadays they even call clever scoundrels decent
      men, because there are no men. Now Africashka plays the enlightened man;
      he has already managed to get into intelligent society, donated something
      to some enterprise or another and thus at once came to the front. Judging
      from his face, he is a sharper of the highest degree, but he will play a
      prominent part, for he knows how to adapt himself. Yes, friend, Africashka
      is a liberal. And a liberal merchant is a mixture of a wolf and a pig with
      a toad and a snake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil take them all!&rdquo; said Foma, waving his hand indifferently. &ldquo;What
      have I to do with them? How about yourself&mdash;do you still keep on
      drinking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do! Why shouldn&rsquo;t I drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half-clad and dishevelled, Yozhov looked like a plucked bird, which had
      just had a fight and had not yet recovered from the excitement of the
      conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drink because, from time to time, I must quench the fire of my wounded
      heart. And you, you damp stump, you are smouldering little by little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to go to the old man,&rdquo; said Foma, wrinkling his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chance it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like going. He&rsquo;ll start to lecture me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you always play the buffoon?&rdquo; said Foma, with displeasure, &ldquo;as
      though you were indeed merry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God, I feel merry!&rdquo; exclaimed Yozhov, jumping down from the table.
      &ldquo;What a fine roasting I gave a certain gentleman in the paper yesterday!
      And then&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard a clever anecdote: A company was sitting on the
      sea-shore philosophizing at length upon life. And a Jew said to them:
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, why do you employ so many different words? I&rsquo;ll tell it to you
      all at once: Our life is not worth a single copeck, even as this stormy
      sea! &lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, the devil take you!&rdquo; said Foma. &ldquo;Good-bye. I am going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead! I am in a fine frame of mind to-day and I will not moan with
      you. All the more so considering you don&rsquo;t moan, but grunt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma went away, leaving Yozhov singing at the top of his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beat the drum and fear not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drum? You are a drum yourself;&rdquo; thought Foma, with irritation, as he
      slowly came out on the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Mayakins he was met by Luba. Agitated and animated, she suddenly
      appeared before him, speaking quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? My God! How pale you are! How thin you&rsquo;ve grown! It seems you have
      been leading a fine life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then her face became distorted with alarm and she exclaimed almost in a
      whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Foma. You don&rsquo;t know. Do you hear? Someone is ringing the bell.
      Perhaps it is he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she rushed out of the room, leaving behind her in the air the rustle
      of her silk gown, and the astonished Foma, who had not even had a chance
      to ask her where her father was. Yakov Tarasovich was at home. Attired in
      his holiday clothes, in a long frock coat with medals on his breast, he
      stood on the threshold with his hands outstretched, clutching at the door
      posts. His green little eyes examined Foma, and, feeling their look upon
      him, Foma raised his head and met them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, my fine gentleman?&rdquo; said the old man, shaking his head
      reproachfully. &ldquo;Where has it pleased you to come from, may I ask? Who has
      sucked off that fat of yours? Or is it true that a pig looks for a puddle,
      and Foma for a place which is worse?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no other words for me?&rdquo; asked Foma, sternly, looking straight
      into the old man&rsquo;s face. And suddenly he noticed that his godfather
      shuddered, his legs trembled, his eyes began to blink repeatedly, and his
      hands clutched the door posts with an effort. Foma advanced toward him,
      presuming that the old man was feeling ill, but Yakov Tarasovich said in a
      dull and angry voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand aside. Get out of the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And his face assumed its usual expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma stepped back and found himself side by side with a rather short,
      stout man, who bowed to Mayakin, and said in a hoarse voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Taras Yakovlich, how are you?&rdquo; said the old man, bowing,
      smiling distractedly, and still clinging to the door posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma stepped aside in confusion, seated himself in an armchair, and,
      petrified with curiosity, wide-eyed, began to watch the meeting of father
      and son.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father, standing in the doorway, swayed his feeble body, leaning his
      hands against the door posts, and, with his head bent on one side and eyes
      half shut, stared at his son in silence. The son stood about three steps
      away from him; his head already gray, was lifted high; he knitted his brow
      and gazed at his father with large dark eyes. His small, black, pointed
      beard and his small moustache quivered on his meagre face, with its
      gristly nose, like that of his father. And the hat, also, quivered in his
      hand. From behind his shoulder Foma saw the pale, frightened and joyous
      face of Luba&mdash;she looked at her father with beseeching eyes and it
      seemed she was on the point of crying out. For a few moments all were
      silent and motionless, crushed as they were by the immensity of their
      emotions. The silence was broken by the low, but dull and quivering voice
      of Yakov Tarasovich:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have grown old, Taras.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The son laughed in his father&rsquo;s face silently, and, with a swift glance,
      surveyed him from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father tearing his hands from the door posts, made a step toward his
      son and suddenly stopped short with a frown. Then Taras Mayakin, with one
      huge step, came up to his father and gave him his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us kiss each other,&rdquo; suggested the father, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two old men convulsively clasped each other in their arms, exchanged
      warm kisses and then stepped apart. The wrinkles of the older man
      quivered, the lean face of the younger was immobile, almost stern. The
      kisses had changed nothing in the external side of this scene, only Lubov
      burst into a sob of joy, and Foma awkwardly moved about in his seat,
      feeling as though his breath were failing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, children, you are wounds to the heart&mdash;you are not its joy,&rdquo;
       complained Yakov Tarasovich in a ringing voice, and he evidently invested
      a great deal in these words, for immediately after he had pronounced them
      he became radiant, more courageous, and he said briskly, addressing
      himself to his daughter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, have you melted with joy? You had better go and prepare something
      for us&mdash;tea and so forth. We&rsquo;ll entertain the prodigal son. You must
      have forgotten, my little old man, what sort of a man your father is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taras Mayakin scrutinized his parent with a meditative look of his large
      eyes and he smiled, speechless, clad in black, wherefore the gray hair on
      his head and in his beard told more strikingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be seated. Tell me&mdash;how have you lived, what have you done?
      What are you looking at? Ah! That&rsquo;s my godson. Ignat Gordyeeff&rsquo;s son,
      Foma. Do you remember Ignat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember everything,&rdquo; said Taras.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s good, if you are not bragging. Well, are you married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a widower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They died. I had two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity. I would have had grandchildren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I smoke?&rdquo; asked Taras.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go ahead. Just look at him, you&rsquo;re smoking cigars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Come on, it&rsquo;s all the same to me. I say that it looks rather
      aristocratic to smoke cigars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why should we consider ourselves lower than the aristocrats?&rdquo; said
      Taras, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do, I consider ourselves lower?&rdquo; exclaimed the old man. &ldquo;I merely said it
      because it looked ridiculous to me, such a sedate old fellow, with beard
      trimmed in foreign fashion, cigar in his mouth. Who is he? My son&mdash;he-he-he!&rdquo;
       the old man tapped Taras on the shoulder and sprang away from him, as
      though frightened lest he were rejoicing too soon, lest that might not be
      the proper way to treat that half gray man. And he looked searchingly and
      suspiciously into his son&rsquo;s large eyes, which were surrounded by yellowish
      swellings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras smiled in his father&rsquo;s face an affable and warm smile, and said to
      him thoughtfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I remember you&mdash;cheerful and lively. It looks as
      though you had not changed a bit during all these years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man straightened himself proudly, and, striking his breast with
      his fist, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never change, because life has no power over him who knows his
      own value. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! How proud you are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must have taken after my son,&rdquo; said the old man with a cunning grimace.
      &ldquo;Do you know, dear, my son was silent for seventeen years out of pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s because his father would not listen to him,&rdquo; Taras reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now. Never mind the past. Only God knows which of us is to
      blame. He, the upright one, He&rsquo;ll tell it to you&mdash;wait! I shall keep
      silence. This is not the time for us to discuss that matter. You better
      tell me&mdash;what have you been doing all these years? How did you come
      to that soda factory? How have you made your way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a long story,&rdquo; said Taras with a sigh; and emitting from his mouth
      a great puff of smoke, he began slowly: &ldquo;When I acquired the possibility
      to live at liberty, I entered the office of the superintendent of the gold
      mines of the Remezovs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know; they&rsquo;re very rich. Three brothers. I know them all. One is a
      cripple, the other a fool, and the third a miser. Go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I served under him for two years. And then I married his daughter,&rdquo;
       narrated Mayakin in a hoarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The superintendent&rsquo;s? That wasn&rsquo;t foolish at all.&rdquo; Taras became
      thoughtful and was silent awhile. The old man looked at his sad face and
      understood his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you lived with your wife happily,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, what can you
      do? To the dead belongs paradise, and the living must live on. You are not
      so very old as yet. Have you been a widower long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the third year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So? And how did you chance upon the soda factory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That belongs to my father-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! What is your salary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About five thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mm. That&rsquo;s not a stale crust. Yes, that&rsquo;s a galley slave for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taras glanced at his father with a firm look and asked him drily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, what makes you think that I was a convict?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man glanced at his son with astonishment, which was quickly
      changed into joy:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! What then? You were not? The devil take them! Then&mdash;how was it?
      Don&rsquo;t take offence! How could I know? They said you were in Siberia! Well,
      and there are the galleys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make an end of this once for all,&rdquo; said Taras, seriously and
      impressively, clapping his hand on his knee, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you right now how
      it all happened. I was banished to Siberia to settle there for six years,
      and, during all the time of my exile, I lived in the mining region of the
      Lena. In Moscow I was imprisoned for about nine months. That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So-o! But what does it mean?&rdquo; muttered Yakov Tarasovich, with confusion
      and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here they circulated that absurd rumour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;it is absurd indeed!&rdquo; said the old man, distressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it did a pretty great deal of harm on a certain occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Is that possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I was about to go into business for myself, and my credit was ruined
      on account of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Yakov Tarasovich, as he spat angrily. &ldquo;Oh, devil! Come,
      come, is that possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma sat all this time in his corner, listening to the conversation
      between the Mayakins, and, blinking perplexedly, he fixedly examined the
      newcomer. Recalling Lubov&rsquo;s bearing toward her brother, and influenced, to
      a certain degree, by her stories about Taras, he expected to see in him
      something unusual, something unlike the ordinary people. He had thought
      that Taras would speak in some peculiar way, would dress in a manner
      peculiar to himself; and in general he would be unlike other people. While
      before him sat a sedate, stout man, faultlessly dressed, with stern eyes,
      very much like his father in face, and the only difference between them
      was that the son had a cigar in his mouth and a black beard. He spoke
      briefly in a business-like way of everyday things&mdash;where was, then,
      that peculiar something about him? Now he began to tell his father of the
      profits in the manufacture of soda. He had not been a galley slave&mdash;Lubov
      had lied! And Foma was very much pleased when he pictured to himself how
      he would speak to Lubov about her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then she appeared in the doorway during the conversation between
      her father and her brother. Her face was radiant with happiness, and her
      eyes beamed with joy as she looked at the black figure of Taras, clad in
      such a peculiarly thick frock coat, with pockets on the sides and with big
      buttons. She walked on tiptoe, and somehow always stretched her neck
      toward her brother. Foma looked at her questioningly, but she did not
      notice him, constantly running back and forth past the door, with plates
      and bottles in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that she glanced into the room just when her brother was
      telling her father about the galleys. She stopped as though petrified,
      holding a tray in her outstretched hands and listened to everything her
      brother said about the punishment inflicted upon him. She listened, and
      slowly walked away, without catching Foma&rsquo;s astonished and sarcastic
      glance. Absorbed in his reflections on Taras, slightly offended by the
      lack of attention shown him, and by the fact that since the handshake at
      the introduction Taras had not given him a single glance, Foma ceased for
      awhile to follow the conversation of the Mayakins, and suddenly he felt
      that someone seized him by the shoulder. He trembled and sprang to his
      feet, almost felling his godfather, who stood before him with excited
      face:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&mdash;look! That is a man! That&rsquo;s what a Mayakin is! They have
      seven times boiled him in lye; they have squeezed oil out of him, and yet
      he lives! Understand? Without any aid&mdash;alone&mdash;he made his way
      and found his place and&mdash;he is proud! That means Mayakin! A Mayakin
      means a man who holds his fate in his own hands. Do you understand? Take a
      lesson from him! Look at him! You cannot find another like him in a
      hundred; you&rsquo;d have to look for one in a thousand. What? Just bear this in
      mind: You cannot forge a Mayakin from man into either devil or angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stupefied by this tempestuous shock, Foma became confused and did not know
      what to say in reply to the old man&rsquo;s noisy song of praise. He saw that
      Taras, calmly smoking his cigar, was looking at his father, and that the
      corners of his lips were quivering with a smile. His face looked
      condescendingly contented, and all his figure somewhat aristocratic and
      haughty. He seemed to be amused by the old man&rsquo;s joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Yakov Tarasovich tapped Foma on the chest with his finger and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know him, my own son. He has not opened his soul to me. It may
      be that such a difference had grown up between us that not only an eagle,
      but the devil himself cannot cross it. Perhaps his blood has overboiled;
      that there is not even the scent of the father&rsquo;s blood in it. But he is a
      Mayakin! And I can feel it at once! I feel it and say: &lsquo;Today thou
      forgivest Thy servant, Oh Lord!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man was trembling with the fever of his exultation, and fairly
      hopped as he stood before Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm yourself, father!&rdquo; said Taras, slowly rising from his chair and
      walking up to his father. &ldquo;Why confuse the young man? Come, let us sit
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave Foma a fleeting smile, and, taking his father by the arm, led him
      toward the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in blood,&rdquo; said Yakov Tarasovich; &ldquo;in hereditary blood. Therein
      lies all power! My father, I remember, told me: &lsquo;Yashka, you are my
      genuine blood!&rsquo; There. The blood of the Mayakins is thick&mdash;it is
      transferred from father to father and no woman can ever weaken it. Let us
      drink some champagne! Shall we? Very well, then! Tell me more&mdash;tell
      me about yourself. How is it there in Siberia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again, as though frightened and sobered by some thought, the old man
      fixed his searching eyes upon the face of his son. And a few minutes later
      the circumstantial but brief replies of his son again aroused in him a
      noisy joy. Foma kept on listening and watching, as he sat quietly in his
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gold mining, of course, is a solid business,&rdquo; said Taras, calmly, with
      importance, &ldquo;but it is a rather risky operation and one requiring a large
      capital. The earth says not a word about what it contains within it. It is
      very profitable to deal with foreigners. Dealings with them, under any
      circumstances, yield an enormous percentage. That is a perfectly
      infallible enterprise. But a weary one, it must be admitted. It does not
      require much brains; there is no room in it for an extraordinary man; a
      man with great enterprising power cannot develop in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov entered and invited them all into the dining-room. When the Mayakins
      stepped out Foma imperceptibly tugged Lubov by the sleeve, and she
      remained with him alone, inquiring hastily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Foma, with a smile. &ldquo;I want to ask you whether you are
      glad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am!&rdquo; exclaimed Lubov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so. What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re queer!&rdquo; said Lubov, looking at him with astonishment. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
      see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Foma, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble with you?&rdquo; said Lubov, looking at him uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you!&rdquo; drawled out Foma, with contemptuous pity. &ldquo;Can your father, can
      the merchant class beget anything good? Can you expect a radish to bring
      forth raspberries? And you lied to me. Taras is this, Taras is that. What
      is in him? A merchant, like the other merchants, and his paunch is also
      that of the real merchant. He-he!&rdquo; He was satisfied, seeing that the girl,
      confused by his words, was biting her lips, now flushing, now turning
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you, Foma,&rdquo; she began, in a choking voice, and suddenly
      stamping her foot, she cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to speak to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the threshold of the room, she turned her angry face to him,
      and ejaculated in a low voice, emphatically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you malicious man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma burst into laughter. He did not feel like going to the table, where
      three happy people were engaged in a lively conversation. He heard their
      merry voices, their contented laughter, the rattle of the dishes, and he
      understood that, with that burden on his heart, there was no place for him
      beside them. Nor was there a place for him anywhere. If all people only
      hated him, even as Lubov hated him now, he would feel more at ease in
      their midst, he thought. Then he would know how to behave with them, would
      find something to say to them. While now he could not understand whether
      they were pitying him or whether they were laughing at him, because he had
      lost his way and could not conform himself to anything. As he stood awhile
      alone in the middle of the room, he unconsciously resolved to leave this
      house where people were rejoicing and where he was superfluous. On
      reaching the street, he felt himself offended by the Mayakins. After all,
      they were the only people near to him in the world. Before him arose his
      godfather&rsquo;s face, on which the wrinkles quivered with agitation, and
      illuminated by the merry glitter of his green eyes, seemed to beam with
      phosphoric light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even a rotten trunk of a tree stands out in the dark!&rdquo; reflected Foma,
      savagely. Then he recalled the calm and serious face of Taras and beside
      it the figure of Lubov bowing herself hastily toward him. That aroused in
      him feelings of envy and sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will look at me like that? There is not a soul to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He came to himself from his broodings on the shore, at the landing-places,
      aroused by the bustle of toil. All sorts of articles and wares were
      carried and carted in every direction; people moved about hastily,
      care-worn, spurring on their horses excitedly, shouting at one another,
      filling the street with unintelligible bustle and deafening noise of
      hurried work. They busied themselves on a narrow strip of ground, paved
      with stone, built up on one side with tall houses, and the other side cut
      off by a steep ravine at the river, and their seething bustle made upon
      Foma an impression as though they had all prepared themselves to flee from
      this toil amid filth and narrowness and tumult&mdash;prepared themselves
      to flee and were now hastening to complete the sooner the unfinished work
      which would not release them. Huge steamers, standing by the shore and
      emitting columns of smoke from their funnels, were already awaiting them.
      The troubled water of the river, closely obstructed with vessels, was
      softly and plaintively splashing against the shore, as though imploring
      for a minute of rest and repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Honour!&rdquo; a hoarse cry rang out near Foma&rsquo;s ears, &ldquo;contribute some
      brandy in honour of the building!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma glanced at the petitioner indifferently; he was a huge, bearded
      fellow, barefooted, with a torn shirt and a bruised, swollen face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away!&rdquo; muttered Foma, and turned away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merchant! When you die you can&rsquo;t take your money with you. Give me for
      one glass of brandy, or are you too lazy to put your hand into your
      pocket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma again looked at the petitioner; the latter stood before him, covered
      more with mud than with clothes, and, trembling with intoxication, waited
      obstinately, staring at Foma with blood-shot, swollen eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the way to ask?&rdquo; inquired Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How else? Would you want me to go down on my knees before you for a
      ten-copeck piece?&rdquo; asked the bare-footed man, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; and Foma gave him a coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks! Fifteen copecks. Thanks! And if you give me fifteen more I&rsquo;ll
      crawl on all fours right up to that tavern. Do you want me to?&rdquo; proposed
      the barefooted man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, leave me alone!&rdquo; said Foma, waving him off with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He who gives not when he may, when he fain would, shall have nay,&rdquo; said
      the barefooted man, and stepped aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma looked at him as he departed, and said to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a ruined man and yet how bold he is. He asks alms as though
      demanding a debt. Where do such people get so much boldness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And heaving a deep sigh, he answered himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From freedom. The man is not fettered. What is there that he should
      regret? What does he fear? And what do I fear? What is there that I should
      regret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These two questions seemed to strike Foma&rsquo;s heart and called forth in him
      a dull perplexity. He looked at the movement of the working people and
      kept on thinking: What did he regret? What did he fear?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alone, with my own strength, I shall evidently never come out anywhere.
      Like a fool I shall keep on tramping about among people, mocked and
      offended by all. If they would only jostle me aside; if they would only
      hate me, then&mdash;then&mdash;I would go out into the wide world! Whether
      I liked or not, I would have to go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From one of the landing wharves the merry &ldquo;dubinushka&rdquo; [&ldquo;Dubinushka,&rdquo; or
      the &ldquo;Oaken Cudgel,&rdquo; is a song popular with the Russian workmen.] had
      already been smiting the air for a long time. The carriers were doing a
      certain work, which required brisk movements, and were adapting the song
      and the refrain to them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;In the tavern sit great merchants
     Drinking liquors strong,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      narrated the leader, in a bold recitative. The company joined in unison:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Oh, dubinushka, heave-ho!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And then the bassos smote the air with deep sounds:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;It goes, it goes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And the tenors repeated:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;It goes, it goes.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Foma listened to the song and directed his footsteps toward it, on the
      wharf. There he noticed that the carriers, formed in two rows, were
      rolling out of the steamer&rsquo;s hold huge barrels of salted fish. Dirty, clad
      in red blouses, unfastened at the collar, with mittens on their hands,
      with arms bare to the elbow, they stood over the hold, and, merrily
      jesting, with faces animated by toil, they pulled the ropes, all together,
      keeping time to their song. And from the hold rang out the high, laughing
      voice of the invisible leader:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;But for our peasant throats
     There is not enough vodka.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      And the company, like one huge pair of lungs, heaved forth loudly and in
      unison:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Oh, dubinushka, heave-ho!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Foma felt pleased and envious as he looked at this work, which was as
      harmonious as music. The slovenly faces of the carriers beamed with
      smiles, the work was easy, it went on smoothly, and the leader of the
      chorus was in his best vein. Foma thought that it would be fine to work
      thus in unison, with good comrades, to the tune of a cheerful song, to get
      tired from work to drink a glass of vodka and eat fat cabbage soup,
      prepared by the stout, sprightly matron of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quicker, boys, quicker!&rdquo; rang out beside him someone&rsquo;s unpleasant, hoarse
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma turned around. A stout man, with an enormous paunch, tapped on the
      boards of the landing bridge with his cane, as he looked at the carriers
      with his small eyes and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bawl less and work faster.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face and neck were covered with perspiration; he wiped it off every
      now and then with his left hand and breathed heavily, as though he were
      going uphill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma cast at the man a hostile look and thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Others are working and he is sweating. And I am still worse than he. I&rsquo;m
      like a crow on the fence, good for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From each and every impression there immediately stood out in his mind the
      painful thought of his unfitness for life. Everything that attracted his
      attention contained something offensive to him, and this something fell
      like a brick upon his breast. At one side of him, by the freight scales,
      stood two sailors, and one of them, a square-built, red-faced fellow, was
      telling the other:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As they rushed on me it began for fair, my dear chap! There were four of
      them&mdash;I was alone! But I didn&rsquo;t give in to them, because I saw that
      they would beat me to death! Even a ram will kick out if you fleece it
      alive. How I tore myself away from them! They all rolled away in different
      directions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you came in for a sound drubbing all the same?&rdquo; inquired the other
      sailor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! I caught it. I swallowed about five blows. But what&rsquo;s the
      difference? They didn&rsquo;t kill me. Well, thank God for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the stern, devils, to the stern, I&rsquo;m telling you!&rdquo; roared the
      perspiring man in a ferocious voice at two carriers who were rolling a
      barrel of fish along the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you yelling for?&rdquo; Foma turned to him sternly, as he had started
      at the shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that any of your business?&rdquo; asked the perspiring man, casting a glance
      at Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my business! The people are working and your fat is melting away.
      So you think you must yell at them?&rdquo; said Foma, threateningly, moving
      closer toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you had better keep your temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The perspiring man suddenly rushed away from his place and went into his
      office. Foma looked after him and also went away from the wharf; filled
      with a desire to abuse some one, to do something, just to divert his
      thoughts from himself at least for a short while. But his thoughts took a
      firmer hold on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sailor there, he tore himself away, and he&rsquo;s safe and sound! Yes,
      while I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening he again went up to the Mayakins. The old man was not at
      home, and in the dining-room sat Lubov with her brother, drinking tea. On
      reaching the door Foma heard the hoarse voice of Taras:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes father bother himself about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of Foma he stopped short, staring at his face with a serious,
      searching look. An expression of agitation was clearly depicted on Lubov&rsquo;s
      face, and she said with dissatisfaction and at the same time
      apologetically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! So it&rsquo;s you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been speaking of me,&rdquo; thought Foma, as he seated himself at the
      table. Taras turned his eyes away from him and sank deeper in the
      armchair. There was an awkward silence lasting for about a minute, and
      this pleased Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to the banquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What banquet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? Kononov is going to consecrate his new steamer. A mass
      will be held there and then they are going to take a trip up the Volga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not invited,&rdquo; said Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody was invited. He simply announced on the Exchange: &lsquo;Anybody who
      wishes to honour me is welcome!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? But there will be a grand drinking bout,&rdquo; said Lubov, looking at him
      askance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can drink at my own expense if I choose to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Lubov, nodding her head expressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taras toyed with his teaspoon, turning it between his fingers and looking
      at them askance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where&rsquo;s my godfather?&rdquo; asked Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went to the bank. There&rsquo;s a meeting of the board of directors today.
      Election of officers is to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll elect him again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again the conversation broke off. Foma began to watch the brother and
      the sister. Having dropped the spoon, Taras slowly drank his tea in big
      sips, and silently moving the glass over to his sister, smiled to her.
      She, too, smiled joyously and happily, seized the glass and began to rinse
      it assiduously. Then her face assumed a strained expression; she seemed to
      prepare herself for something and asked her brother in a low voice, almost
      reverently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we return to the beginning of our conversation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; assented Taras, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said something, but I didn&rsquo;t understand. What was it? I asked: &lsquo;If
      all this is, as you say, Utopia, if it is impossible, dreams, then what is
      he to do who is not satisfied with life as it is?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl leaned her whole body toward her brother, and her eyes, with
      strained expectation, stopped on the calm face of her brother. He glanced
      at her in a weary way, moved about in his seat, and, lowering his head,
      said calmly and impressively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must consider from what source springs that dissatisfaction with life.
      It seems to me that, first of all, it comes from the inability to work;
      from the lack of respect for work. And, secondly, from a wrong conception
      of one&rsquo;s own powers. The misfortune of most of the people is that they
      consider themselves capable of doing more than they really can. And yet
      only little is required of man: he must select for himself an occupation
      to suit his powers and must master it as well as possible, as attentively
      as possible. You must love what you are doing, and then labour, be it ever
      so rough, rises to the height of creativeness. A chair, made with love,
      will always be a good, beautiful and solid chair. And so it is with
      everything. Read Smiles. Haven&rsquo;t you read him? It is a very sensible book.
      It is a sound book. Read Lubbock. In general, remember that the English
      people constitute the nation most qualified for labour, which fact
      explains their astonishing success in the domain of industry and commerce.
      With them labour is almost a cult. The height of culture stands always
      directly dependent upon the love of labour. And the higher the culture the
      more satisfied are the requirements of man, the fewer the obstacles on the
      road toward the further development of man&rsquo;s requirements. Happiness is
      possible&mdash;it is the complete satisfaction of requirements. There it
      is. And, as you see, man&rsquo;s happiness is dependent upon his relation toward
      his work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taras Mayakin spoke slowly and laboriously, as though it were unpleasant
      and tedious for him to speak. And Lubov, with knitted brow, leaning toward
      him, listened to his words with eager attention in her eyes, ready to
      accept everything and imbibe it into her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, and suppose everything is repulsive to a man?&rdquo; asked Foma,
      suddenly, in a deep voice, casting a glance at Taras&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what, in particular, is repulsive to the man?&rdquo; asked Mayakin, calmly,
      without looking at Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma bent his head, leaned his arms against the table and thus, like a
      bull, went on to explain himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing pleases him&mdash;business, work, all people and deeds. Suppose I
      see that all is deceit, that business is not business, but merely a plug
      that we prop up with it the emptiness of our souls; that some work, while
      others only give orders and sweat, but get more for that. Why is it so?
      Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot grasp your idea,&rdquo; announced Taras, when Foma paused, feeling on
      himself Lubov&rsquo;s contemptuous and angry look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not understand?&rdquo; asked Foma, looking at Taras with a smile. &ldquo;Well,
      I&rsquo;ll put it in this way:
    </p>
    <p>
      A man is sailing in a boat on the river. The boat may be good, but under
      it there is always a depth all the same. The boat is sound, but if the man
      feels beneath him this dark depth, no boat can save him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taras looked at Foma indifferently and calmly. He looked in silence, and
      softly tapped his fingers on the edge of the table. Lubov was uneasily
      moving about in her chair. The pendulum of the clock told the seconds with
      a dull, sighing sound. And Foma&rsquo;s heart throbbed slowly and painfully, as
      though conscious that here no one would respond with a warm word to its
      painful perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work is not exactly everything for a man,&rdquo; said he, more to himself than
      to these people who had no faith in the sincerity of his words. &ldquo;It is not
      true that in work lies justification. There are people who do not work at
      all during all their lives long, and yet they live better than those that
      do work. How is that? And the toilers&mdash;they are merely unfortunate&mdash;horses!
      Others ride on them, they suffer and that&rsquo;s all. But they have their
      justification before God. They will be asked: &lsquo;To what purpose did you
      live?&rsquo; Then they will say: &lsquo;We had no time to think of that. We worked all
      our lives.&rsquo; And I&mdash;what justification have I? And all those people
      who give orders&mdash;how will they justify themselves? To what purpose
      have they lived? It is my idea that everybody necessarily ought to know,
      to know firmly what he is living for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He became silent, and, tossing his head up, exclaimed in a heavy voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can it be that man is born merely to work, acquire money, build a house,
      beget children and&mdash;die? No, life means something. A man is born, he
      lives and dies. What for? It is necessary, by God, it is necessary for all
      of us to consider what we are living for. There is no sense in our life.
      No sense whatever! Then things are not equal, that can be seen at once.
      Some are rich&mdash;they have money enough for a thousand people, and they
      live in idleness. Others bend their backs over their work all their lives,
      and yet they have not even a grosh. And the difference in people is very
      insignificant. There are some that have not even any trousers and yet they
      reason as though they were attired in silks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carried away by his thoughts, Foma would have continued to give them
      utterance, but Taras moved his armchair away from the table, rose and said
      softly, with a sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you! I don&rsquo;t want any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma broke off his speech abruptly, shrugged his shoulders and looked at
      Lubov with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you picked up such philosophy?&rdquo; she asked, suspiciously and
      drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not philosophy. That is simply torture!&rdquo; said Foma in an
      undertone. &ldquo;Open your eyes and look at everything. Then you will think so
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Luba, turn your attention to the fact,&rdquo; began Taras, standing
      with his back toward the table and scrutinizing the clock, &ldquo;that pessimism
      is perfectly foreign to the Anglo-Saxon race. That which they call
      pessimism in Swift and in Byron is only a burning, sharp protest against
      the imperfection of life and man. But you cannot find among them the cold,
      well weighed and passive pessimism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as though suddenly recalling Foma, he turned to him, clasping his
      hands behind his back, and, wriggling his thigh, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You raise very important questions, and if you are seriously interested
      in them you must read books. In them will you find many very valuable
      opinions as to the meaning of life. How about you&mdash;do you read
      books?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; replied Foma, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! But they might nevertheless be of some help to you,&rdquo; said Taras, and
      a smile passed across his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Books? Since men cannot help me in my thoughts books can certainly do
      nothing for me,&rdquo; ejaculated Foma, morosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to feel awkward and weary with this indifferent man. He felt like
      going away, but at the same time he wished to tell Lubov something
      insulting about her brother, and he waited till Taras would leave the
      room. Lubov washed the dishes; her face was concentrated and thoughtful;
      her hands moved lazily. Taras was pacing the room, now and then he stopped
      short before the sideboard on which was the silverware, whistled, tapped
      his fingers against the window-panes and examined the articles with his
      eyes half shut. The pendulum of the clock flashed beneath the glass door
      of the case like some broad, grinning face, and monotonously told the
      seconds. When Foma noticed that Lubov glanced at him a few times
      questioningly, with expectant and hostile looks, he understood that he was
      in her way and that she was impatiently expecting him to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to stay here over night,&rdquo; said he, with a smile. &ldquo;I must speak
      with my godfather. And then it is rather lonesome in my house alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go and tell Marfusha to make the bed for you in the corner room,&rdquo;
       Lubov hastened to advise him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He arose and went out of the dining-room. And he soon heard that Taras
      asked his sister about something in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About me!&rdquo; he thought. Suddenly this wicked thought flashed through his
      mind: &ldquo;It were but right to listen and hear what wise people have to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed softly, and, stepping on tiptoe, went noiselessly into the
      other room, also adjoining the dining-room. There was no light there, and
      only a thin band of light from the dining-room, passing through the
      unclosed door, lay on the dark floor. Softly, with sinking heart and
      malicious smile, Foma walked up close to the door and stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a clumsy fellow,&rdquo; said Taras.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Lubov&rsquo;s lowered and hasty speech:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was carousing here all the time. He carried on dreadfully! It all
      started somehow of a sudden. The first thing he did was to thrash the
      son-in-law of the Vice-Governor at the Club. Papa had to take the greatest
      pains to hush up the scandal, and it was a good thing that the
      Vice-Governor&rsquo;s son-in-law is a man of very bad reputation. He is a
      card-sharper and in general a shady personality, yet it cost father more
      than two thousand roubles. And while papa was busying himself about that
      scandal Foma came near drowning a whole company on the Volga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha-ha! How monstrous! And that same man busies himself with investigating
      as to the meaning of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On another occasion he was carousing on a steamer with a company of
      people like himself. Suddenly he said to them: &lsquo;Pray to God! I&rsquo;ll fling
      every one of you overboard!&rsquo; He is frightfully strong. They screamed,
      while he said: &lsquo;I want to serve my country. I want to clear the earth of
      base people.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s clever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a terrible man! How many wild pranks he has perpetrated during these
      years! How much money he has squandered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, tell me, on what conditions does father manage his affairs for him?
      Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. He has a full power of attorney. Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Simply so. It&rsquo;s a solid business. Of course it is conducted in purely
      Russian fashion; in other words, it is conducted abominably. But it is a
      splendid business, nevertheless. If it were managed properly it would be a
      most profitable gold mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foma does absolutely nothing. Everything is in father&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? That&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, sometimes it occurs to me that his thoughtful frame of mind&mdash;that
      these words of his are sincere, and that he can be very decent. But I
      cannot reconcile his scandalous life with his words and arguments. I
      cannot do it under any circumstances!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t even worthwhile to bother about it. The stripling and lazy bones
      seeks to justify his laziness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You see, at times he is like a child. He was particularly so before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I have said: he&rsquo;s a stripling. Is it worth while
      talking about an ignoramus and a savage, who wishes to remain an ignoramus
      and a savage, and does not conceal the fact? You see: he reasons as the
      bear in the fable bent the shafts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very harsh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am harsh! People require that. We Russians are all desperately
      loose. Happily, life is so arranged that, whether we will it or not, we
      gradually brace up. Dreams are for the lads and maidens, but for serious
      people there is serious business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes I feel very sorry for Foma. What will become of him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does not concern me. I believe that nothing in particular will
      become of him&mdash;neither good nor bad. The insipid fellow will squander
      his money away, and will be ruined. What else? Eh, the deuce take him!
      Such people as he is are rare nowadays. Now the merchant knows the power
      of education. And he, that foster-brother of yours, he will go to ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, sir!&rdquo; said Foma, opening the door and appearing on the
      threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pale, with knitted brow and quivering lips, he stared straight into
      Taras&rsquo;s face and said in a dull voice: &ldquo;True! I will go to ruin and&mdash;amen!
      The sooner the better!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lubov sprang up from the chair with frightened face, and ran up to Taras,
      who stood calmly in the middle of the room, with his hands thrust in his
      pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foma! Oh! Shame! You have been eavesdropping. Oh, Foma!&rdquo; said she in
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep quiet, you lamb!&rdquo; said Foma to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, eavesdropping is wrong!&rdquo; ejaculated Taras, slowly, without lifting
      from Foma his look of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be wrong!&rdquo; said Foma, with a wave of the hand. &ldquo;Is it my fault
      that the truth can be learned by eavesdropping only?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away, Foma, please!&rdquo; entreated Lubov, pressing close to her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you have something to say to me?&rdquo; asked Taras, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; exclaimed Foma. &ldquo;What can I say? I cannot say anything. It is you who&mdash;you,
      I believe, know everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have nothing then to discuss with me?&rdquo; asked Taras again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned sideways to Foma and inquired of Lubov:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think&mdash;will father return soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma looked at him, and, feeling something akin to respect for the man,
      deliberately left the house. He did not feel like going to his own huge
      empty house, where each step of his awakened a ringing echo, he strolled
      along the street, which was enveloped in the melancholy gray twilight of
      late autumn. He thought of Taras Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How severe he is. He takes after his father. Only he&rsquo;s not so restless.
      He&rsquo;s also a cunning rogue, I think, while Lubka regarded him almost as a
      saint. That foolish girl! What a sermon he read to me! A regular judge.
      And she&mdash;she was kind toward me.&rdquo; But all these thoughts stirred in
      him no feelings&mdash;neither hatred toward Taras nor sympathy for Lubov.
      He carried with him something painful and uncomfortable, something
      incomprehensible to him, that kept growing within his breast, and it
      seemed to him that his heart was swollen and was gnawing as though from an
      abscess. He hearkened to that unceasing and indomitable pain, noticed that
      it was growing more and more acute from hour to hour, and, not knowing how
      to allay it, waited for the results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his godfather&rsquo;s trotter passed him. Foma saw in the carriage the
      small figure of Yakov Mayakin, but even that aroused no feeling in him. A
      lamplighter ran past Foma, overtook him, placed his ladder against the
      lamp post and went up. The ladder suddenly slipped under his weight, and
      he, clasping the lamp post, cursed loudly and angrily. A girl jostled Foma
      in the side with her bundle and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her and said nothing. Then a drizzling rain began to fall
      from the sky&mdash;tiny, scarcely visible drops of moisture overcast the
      lights of the lanterns and the shop windows with grayish dust. This dust
      made him breathe with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go to Yozhov and pass the night there? I might drink with him,&rdquo;
       thought Foma and went away to Yozhov, not having the slightest desire
      either to see the feuilleton-writer or to drink with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Yozhov&rsquo;s he found a shaggy fellow sitting on the lounge. He had on a
      blouse and gray pantaloons. His face was swarthy, as though smoked, his
      eyes were large, immobile and angry, his thick upper lip was covered with
      a bristle-like, soldier moustache. He was sitting on the lounge, with his
      feet clasped in his huge arms and his chin resting on his knees. Yozhov
      sat sideways in a chair, with his legs thrown across the arm of the chair.
      Among books and newspapers on the table stood a bottle of vodka and there
      was an odour of something salty in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you tramping about?&rdquo; Yozhov asked Foma, and, nodding at him, said
      to the man on the lounge: &ldquo;Gordyeeff!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man glanced at the newcomer and said in a harsh, shrill voice:
      &ldquo;Krasnoshchokov.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma seated himself on a corner of the lounge and said to Yozhov:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to stay here over night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? Go on, Vasily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter glanced at Foma askance and went on in a creaking voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion, you are attacking the stupid people in vain. Masaniello
      was a fool, but what had to be performed was done in the best way
      possible. And that Winkelried was certainly a fool also, and yet had he
      not thrust the imperial spears into himself the Swiss would have been
      thrashed. Have there not been many fools like that? Yet they are the
      heroes. And the clever people are the cowards. Where they ought to deal
      the obstacle a blow with all their might they stop to reflect: &lsquo;What will
      come of it? Perhaps we may perish in vain?&rsquo; And they stand there like
      posts&mdash;until they breathe their last. And the fool is brave! He
      rushes headforemost against the wall&mdash;bang! If his skull breaks&mdash;what
      of it? Calves&rsquo; heads are not dear. And if he makes a crack in the wall the
      clever people will pick it open into gates, will pass and credit
      themselves with the honour. No, Nikolay Matveyich, bravery is a good thing
      even though it be without reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vasily, you are talking nonsense!&rdquo; said Yozhov, stretching his hand
      toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, of course!&rdquo; assented Vasily. &ldquo;How am I to sip cabbage soup with a
      bast shoe? And yet I am not blind. I can see. There is plenty of brains,
      but no good comes of it. During the time the clever people think and
      reflect as to how to act in the wisest way, the fools will down them.
      That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a little!&rdquo; said Yozhov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! I am on duty today. I am rather late as it is. I&rsquo;ll drop in
      tomorrow&mdash;may I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! I&rsquo;ll give a roasting!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly your business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vasily adjusted himself slowly, rose from the lounge, took Yozhov&rsquo;s
      yellow, thin little hand in his big, swarthy paw and pressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodbye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he nodded toward Foma and went through the door sideways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen?&rdquo; Yozhov asked Foma, pointing his hand at the door, behind
      which the heavy footsteps still resounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a man is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assistant machinist, Vaska Krasnoshchokov. Here, take an example from
      him: At the age of fifteen he began to study, to read and write, and at
      twenty-eight he has read the devil knows how many good books, and has
      mastered two languages to perfection. Now he&rsquo;s going abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; inquired Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To study. To see how people live there, while you languish here&mdash;what
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He spoke sensibly of the fools,&rdquo; said Foma, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, for I am not a fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was well said. The stupid man ought to act at once. Rush forward and
      overturn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, he&rsquo;s broken loose!&rdquo; exclaimed Yozhov. &ldquo;You better tell me whether
      it is true that Mayakin&rsquo;s son has returned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see by your face that there is something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know all about his son; we&rsquo;ve heard about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well? What sort of man is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil knows him! What have I to do with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he like his father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s stouter, plumper; there is more seriousness about him; he is so
      cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which means that he will be even worse than Yashka. Well, now, my dear,
      be on your guard or they will suck you dry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let them do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll rob you. You&rsquo;ll become a pauper. That Taras fleeced his
      father-in-law in Yekateringburg so cleverly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him fleece me too, if he likes. I shall not say a word to him except
      &lsquo;thanks.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still singing that same old tune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be set at liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop it! What do you want freedom for? What will you do with it? Don&rsquo;t
      you know that you are not fit for anything, that you are illiterate, that
      you certainly cannot even split a log of wood? Now, if I could only free
      myself from the necessity of drinking vodka and eating bread!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov jumped to his feet, and, stopping in front of Foma, began to speak
      in a loud voice, as though declaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would gather together the remains of my wounded soul, and together with
      the blood of my heart I would spit them into the face of our intelligent
      society, the devil take it! I would say to them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You insects, you are the best sap of my country! The fact of your
      existence has been repaid by the blood and the tears of scores of
      generations of Russian people. O, you nits! How dearly your country has
      paid for you! What are you doing for its sake in return? Have you
      transformed the tears of the past into pearls? What have you contributed
      toward life? What have you accomplished? You have permitted yourselves to
      be conquered? What are you doing? You permit yourselves to be mocked.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stamped his feet with rage, and setting his teeth together stared at
      Foma with burning, angry looks, and resembled an infuriated wild beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would say to them: &lsquo;You! You reason too much, but you are not very
      wise, and you are utterly powerless, and you are all cowards! Your hearts
      are filled up with morality and noble intentions, but they are as soft and
      warm as feather beds; the spirit of creativeness sleeps within them a
      profound and calm sleep, and your hearts do not throb, they merely rock
      slowly, like cradles.&rsquo; Dipping my finger in the blood of my heart, I would
      smear upon their brows the brands of my reproaches, and they, paupers in
      spirit, miserable in their self-contentment, they would suffer. Oh, how
      they would suffer! My scourge is sharp, my hand is firm! And I love too
      deeply to have compassion! They would suffer! And now they do not suffer,
      for they speak of their sufferings too much, too often, and too loud! They
      lie! Genuine suffering is mute, and genuine passion knows no bounds!
      Passions, passions! When will they spring up in the hearts of men? We are
      all miserable because of apathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Short of breath he burst into a fit of coughing, he coughed for a long
      time, hopping about hither and thither, waving his hands like a madman.
      And then he again stopped in front of Foma with pale face and blood-shot
      eyes. He breathed heavily, his lips trembled now and then, displaying his
      small, sharp teeth. Dishevelled, with his head covered with short heir, he
      looked like a perch just thrown out of the water. This was not the first
      time Foma saw him in such a state, and, as always, he was infected by his
      agitation. He listened to the fiery words of the small man, silently,
      without attempting to understand their meaning, having no desire to know
      against whom they were directed, absorbing their force only. Yozhov&rsquo;s
      words bubbled on like boiling water, and heated his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say to them, to those miserable idlers:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look! Life goes onward, leaving you behind!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma, ecstatically, and began to move about
      on the lounge. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a hero, Nikolay! Oh! Go ahead! Throw it right into
      their faces!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Yozhov was not in need of encouragement, it seemed even as though he
      had not heard at all Foma&rsquo;s exclamations, and he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know the limitations of my powers. I know they&rsquo;ll shout at me: &lsquo;Hold
      your peace!&rsquo; They&rsquo;ll tell me: &lsquo;Keep silence!&rsquo; They will say it wisely,
      they will say it calmly, mocking me, they will say it from the height of
      their majesty. I know I am only a small bird, Oh, I am not a nightingale!
      Compared with them I am an ignorant man, I am only a feuilleton-writer, a
      man to amuse the public. Let them cry and silence me, let them do it! A
      blow will fall on my cheek, but the heart will nevertheless keep on
      throbbing! And I will say to them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, I am an ignorant man! And my first advantage over you is that I do
      not know a single book-truth dearer to me than a man! Man is the universe,
      and may he live forever who carries the whole world within him! And you,&rsquo; I
      will say, &lsquo;for the sake of a word which, perhaps, does not always contain
      a meaning comprehensible to you, for the sake of a word you often inflict
      sores and wounds on one another, for the sake of a word you spurt one
      another with bile, you assault the soul. For this, believe me, life will
      severely call you to account: a storm will break loose, and it will whisk
      and wash you off the earth, as wind and rain whisk and wash the dust off a
      tree I There is in human language only one word whose meaning is clear and
      dear to everybody, and when that word is pronounced, it sounds thus:
      &lsquo;Freedom!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crush on!&rdquo; roared Foma, jumping up from the lounge and grasping Yozhov by
      the shoulders. With flashing eyes he gazed into Yozhov&rsquo;s face, bending
      toward him, and almost moaned with grief and affliction: &ldquo;Oh! Nikolay! My
      dear fellow, I am mortally sorry for you! I am more sorry than words can
      tell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; cried Yozhov, pushing him away,
      amazed and shifted from his position by Foma&rsquo;s unexpected outburst and
      strange words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, brother!&rdquo; said Foma, lowering his voice, which thus sounded deeper,
      more persuasive. &ldquo;Oh, living soul, why do you sink to ruin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? I? I sink? You lie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy! You will not say anything to anybody! There is no one to
      speak to! Who will listen to you? Only I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to the devil!&rdquo; shouted Yozhov, angrily, jumping away from him as
      though he had been scorched.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Foma went toward him, and spoke convincingly, with intense sorrow:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak! speak to me! I shall carry away your words to the proper place. I
      understand them. And, ah! how I will scorch the people! Just wait! My
      opportunity will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away!&rdquo; screamed Yozhov, hysterically, squeezing his back to the wall,
      under Foma&rsquo;s pressure. Perplexed, crushed, and infuriated he stood and
      waved off Foma&rsquo;s arms outstretched toward him. And at this time the door
      of the room opened, and on the threshold appeared a woman all in black.
      Her face was angry-looking and excited, her cheek was tied up with a
      kerchief. She tossed her head back, stretched out her hand toward Yozhov
      and said, in a hissing and shrill voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nikolay Matveyich! Excuse me, but this is impossible! Such beast-like
      howling and roaring. Guests everyday. The police are coming. No, I can&rsquo;t
      bear it any longer! I am nervous. Please vacate the lodgings to-morrow.
      You are not living in a desert, there are people about you here. And an
      educated man at that! A writer! All people require rest. I have a
      toothache. I request you to move tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll paste up a notice, I&rsquo;ll
      notify the police.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke rapidly, and the majority of her words were lost in the hissing
      and whistling of her voice; only those words were distinct, which she
      shrieked out in a shrill, irritated tone. The corners of her kerchief
      protruded on her head like small horns, and shook from the movement of her
      jaws. At the sight of her agitated and comical figure Foma gradually
      retreated toward the lounge, while Yozhov stood, and wiping his forehead,
      stared at her fixedly, and listened to her words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So know it now!&rdquo; she screamed, and behind the door, she said once more:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tomorrow! What an outrage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil!&rdquo; whispered Yozhov, staring dully at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes! what a woman! How strict!&rdquo; said Foma, looking at him in amazement,
      as he seated himself on the lounge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov, raising his shoulders, walked up to the table, poured out a half a
      tea-glass full of vodka, emptied it and sat down by the table, bowing his
      head low. There was silence for about a minute. Then Foma said, timidly
      and softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How it all happened! We had no time even to wink an eye, and, suddenly,
      such an outcome. Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Yozhov in an undertone, tossing up his head, and staring at
      Foma angrily and wildly. &ldquo;Keep quiet! You, the devil take you. Lie down
      and sleep! You monster. Nightmare. Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he threatened Foma with his fist. Then he filled the glass with more
      brandy, and emptied it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later Foma lay undressed on the lounge, and, with half-shut
      eyes, followed Yozhov who sat by the table in an awkward pose. He stared
      at the floor, and his lips were quietly moving. Foma was astonished, he
      could not make out why Yozhov had become angry at him. It could not be
      because he had been ordered to move out. For it was he himself who had
      been shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh devil!&rdquo; whispered Yozhov, and gnashed his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma quietly lifted his head from the pillow. Yozhov deeply and noisily
      sighing, again stretched out his hand toward the bottle. Then Foma said to
      him softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to some hotel. It isn&rsquo;t late yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov looked at him, and, rubbing his head with his hands, began to laugh
      strangely. Then he rose from his chair and said to Foma curtly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dress yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And seeing how clumsily and slowly he turned on the lounge, Yozhov shouted
      with anger and impatience:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, be quicker! You personification of stupidity. You symbolical
      cart-shaft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t curse!&rdquo; said Foma, with a peaceable smile. &ldquo;Is it worthwhile to be
      angry because a woman has cackled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov glanced at him, spat and burst into harsh laughter.

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ARE all here?&rdquo; asked Ilya Yefimovich Kononov, standing on the bow of his
      new steamer, and surveying the crowd of guests with beaming eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And raising upward his stout, red, happy-looking face, he shouted to the
      captain, who was already standing on the bridge, beside the speaking-tube:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cast off, Petrukha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain bared his huge, bald head, made the sign of the cross,
      glancing up at the sky, passed his hand over his wide, black beard,
      cleared his throat, and gave the command:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The guests watched the movements of the captain silently and attentively,
      and, emulating his example, they also began to cross themselves, at which
      performance their caps and high hats flashed through the air like a flock
      of black birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us Thy blessing, Oh Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Kononov with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let go astern! Forward!&rdquo; ordered the captain. The massive &ldquo;Ilya
      Murometz,&rdquo; heaving a mighty sigh, emitted a thick column of white steam
      toward the side of the landing-bridge, and started upstream easily, like a
      swan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How it started off,&rdquo; enthusiastically exclaimed commercial counsellor Lup
      Grigoryev Reznikov, a tall, thin, good-looking man. &ldquo;Without a quiver!
      Like a lady in the dance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half speed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a ship, it&rsquo;s a Leviathan!&rdquo; remarked with a devout sigh the
      pock-marked and stooping Trofim Zubov, cathedral-warden and principal
      usurer in town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a gray day. The sky, overcast with autumn clouds, was reflected in
      the water of the river, thus giving it a cold leaden colouring. Flashing
      in the freshness of its paint the steamer sailed along the monotonous
      background of the river like a huge bright spot, and the black smoke of
      its breath hung in the air like a heavy cloud. All white, with pink
      paddle-boxes and bright red blades, the steamer easily cut through the
      cold water with its bow and drove it apart toward the shores, and the
      round window-panes on the sides of the steamer and the cabin glittered
      brilliantly, as though smiling a self-satisfied, triumphant smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of this honourable company!&rdquo; exclaimed Kononov, removing his
      hat, and making a low bow to the guests. &ldquo;As we have now rendered unto
      God, so to say, what is due to God, would you permit that the musicians
      render now unto the Emperor what is due to the Emperor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, without waiting for an answer from his guests, he placed his fist to
      his mouth, and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Musicians! Play &lsquo;Be Glorious!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The military orchestra, behind the engine, thundered out the march.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Makar Bobrov, the director and founder of the local commercial bank,
      began to hum in a pleasant basso, beating time with his fingers on his
      enormous paunch:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be glorious, be glorious, our Russian Czar&mdash;tra-rata! Boom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I invite you to the table, gentlemen! Please! Take pot-luck, he, he! I
      entreat you humbly,&rdquo; said Kononov, pushing himself through the dense group
      of guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were about thirty of them, all sedate men, the cream of the local
      merchants. The older men among them, bald-headed and gray, wore
      old-fashioned frock-coats, caps and tall boots. But there were only few of
      these; high silk hats, shoes and stylish coats reigned supreme. They were
      all crowded on the bow of the steamer, and little by little, yielding to
      Kononov&rsquo;s requests, moved towards the stern covered with sailcloth, where
      stood tables spread with lunch. Lup Reznikov walked arm in arm with Yakov
      Mayakin, and, bending over to his ear, whispered something to him, while
      the latter listened and smiled. Foma, who had been brought to the festival
      by his godfather, after long admonitions, found no companion for himself
      among these people who were repulsive to him, and, pale and gloomy, held
      himself apart from them. During the past two days he had been drinking
      heavily with Yozhov, and now he had a terrible headache. He felt ill at
      ease in the sedate and yet jolly company; the humming of the voices, the
      thundering of the music and the clamour of the steamer, all these
      irritated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a pressing need to doze off, and he could find no rest from the
      thought as to why his godfather was so kind to him today, and why he
      brought him hither into the company of the foremost merchants of the town.
      Why had he urged so persuasively, and even entreated him to attend
      Kononov&rsquo;s mass and banquet?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, come!&rdquo; Foma recalled his godfather&rsquo;s admonitions. &ldquo;Why
      do you fight shy of people? Man gets his character from nature, and in
      riches you are lower than very few. You must keep yourself on an equal
      footing with the others. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when are you going to speak seriously with me, papa?&rdquo; Foma had asked,
      watching the play of his godfather&rsquo;s face and green eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean about setting you free from the business? Ha, ha! We&rsquo;ll talk it
      over, we&rsquo;ll talk it over, my friend! What a queer fellow you are. Well?
      Will you enter a monastery when you have thrown away your wealth? After
      the example of the saints? Eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see then!&rdquo; Foma had answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So. Well, and meanwhile, before you go to the monastery, come along with
      me! Get ready quickly. Rub your phiz with something wet, for it is very
      much swollen. Sprinkle yourself with cologne, get it from Lubov, to drive
      away the smell of the kabak. Go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arriving on the steamer while the mass was in progress, Foma took up a
      place on the side and watched the merchants during the whole service.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood in solemn silence; their faces had an expression of devout
      concentration; they prayed with fervour, deeply sighing, bowing low,
      devoutly lifting their eyes heavenward. And Foma looked now at one, now at
      another, and recalled what he knew about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Lup Reznikov; he had begun his career as a brothel-keeper, and
      had become rich all of a sudden. They said he had strangled one of his
      guests, a rich Siberian. Zubov&rsquo;s business in his youth had been to
      purchase thread from the peasants. He had failed twice. Kononov had been
      tried twenty years ago for arson, and even now he was indicted for the
      seduction of a minor. Together with him, for the second time already, on a
      similar charge, Zakhar Kirillov Robustov had been dragged to court.
      Robustov was a stout, short merchant with a round face and cheerful blue
      eyes. Among these people there was hardly one about whom Foma did not know
      something disgraceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he knew that they were all surely envying the successful Kononov, who
      was constantly increasing the number of his steamers from year to year.
      Many of those people were at daggers&rsquo; points with one another, none of
      them would show mercy to the others in the battlefield of business, and
      all knew wicked and dishonest things about one another. But now, when they
      gathered around Kononov, who was triumphant and happy, they blended in one
      dense, dark mass, and stood and breathed as one man, concentrated and
      silent, surrounded by something invisible yet firm, by something which
      repulsed Foma from them, and which inspired him with fear of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impostors!&rdquo; thought he, thus encouraging himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they coughed gently, sighed, crossed themselves, bowed, and,
      surrounding the clergy in a thick wall, stood immovable and firm, like
      big, black rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are pretending!&rdquo; Foma exclaimed to himself. Beside him stood the
      hump-backed, one-eyed Pavlin Gushchin&mdash;he who, not long before, had
      turned the children of his half-witted brother into the street as beggars&mdash;he
      stood there and whispered penetratingly as he looked at the gloomy sky
      with his single eye:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord! Do not convict me in Thy wrath, nor chastise me in Thy
      indignation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Foma felt that that man was addressing the Lord with the most profound
      and firm faith in His mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord, God of our fathers, who hadst commanded Noah, Thy servant, to
      build an ark for the preservation of the world,&rdquo; said the priest in his
      deep bass voice, lifting his eyes and outstretching his hands skyward,
      &ldquo;protect also this vessel and give unto it a guarding angel of good and
      peace. Guard those that will sail upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The merchants in unison made the sign of the cross, with wide swings of
      their arms, and all their faces bore the expression of one sentiment&mdash;faith
      in the power of prayer. All these pictures took root in Foma&rsquo;s memory and
      awakened in him perplexity as to these people, who, being able to believe
      firmly in the mercy of God, were, nevertheless, so cruel unto man. He
      watched them persistently, wishing to detect their fraud, to convince
      himself of their falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their grave firmness angered him, their unanimous self-confidence, their
      triumphant faces, their loud voices, their laughter. They were already
      seated by the tables, covered with luncheon, and were hungrily admiring
      the huge sturgeon, almost three yards in length, nicely sprinkled over
      with greens and large crabs. Trofim Zubov, tying a napkin around his neck,
      looked at the monster fish with happy, sweetly half-shut eyes, and said to
      his neighbour, the flour merchant, Yona Yushkov:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yona Nikiforich! Look, it&rsquo;s a regular whale! It&rsquo;s big enough to serve as
      a casket for your person, eh? Ha, ha! You could creep into it as a foot
      into a boot, eh? Ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The small-bodied and plump Yona carefully stretched out his short little
      hand toward the silver pail filled with fresh caviar, smacked his lips
      greedily, and squinted at the bottles before him, fearing lest he might
      overturn them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite Kononov, on a trestle, stood a half-vedro barrel of old vodka,
      imported from Poland; in a huge silver-mounted shell lay oysters, and a
      certain particoloured cake, in the shape of a tower, stood out above all
      the viands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen! I entreat you! Help yourselves to whatever you please!&rdquo; cried
      Kononov. &ldquo;I have here everything at once to suit the taste of everyone.
      There is our own, Russian stuff, and there is foreign, all at once! That&rsquo;s
      the best way! Who wishes anything? Does anybody want snails, or these
      crabs, eh? They&rsquo;re from India, I am told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Zubov said to his neighbour, Mayakin:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prayer &lsquo;At the Building of a Vessel&rsquo; is not suitable for steam-tugs
      and river steamers, that is, not that it is not suitable, it isn&rsquo;t enough
      alone. A river steamer is a place of permanent residence for the crew, and
      therefore it ought to be considered as a house. Consequently it is
      necessary to make the prayer &lsquo;At the Building of a House,&rsquo; in addition to
      that for the vessel. But what will you drink?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not much of a wine fiend. Pour me out some cumin vodka,&rdquo; replied
      Yakov Tarasovich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma, seated at the end of the table among some timid and modest men who
      were unfamiliar to him, now and again felt on himself the sharp glances of
      the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid I&rsquo;ll make a scandal,&rdquo; thought Foma. &ldquo;Brethren!&rdquo; roared the
      monstrously stout ship builder Yashchurov, in a hoarse voice, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do
      without herring! I must necessarily begin with herring, that&rsquo;s my nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Musicians! strike up &lsquo;The Persian March!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on! Better &lsquo;How Glorious!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike up &lsquo;How Glorious.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The puffing of the engine and the clatter of the steamer&rsquo;s wheels,
      mingling with the sounds of the music, produced in the air something which
      sounded like the wild song of a snow-storm. The whistle of the flute, the
      shrill singing of the clarionets, the heavy roaring of the basses, the
      ruffling of the little drum and the drones of the blows on the big one,
      all this fell on the monotonous and dull sounds of the wheels, as they cut
      the water apart, smote the air rebelliously, drowned the noise of the
      human voices and hovered after the steamer, like a hurricane, causing the
      people to shout at the top of their voices. At times an angry hissing of
      steam rang out within the engine, and there was something irritable and
      contemptuous in this sound as it burst unexpectedly upon the chaos of the
      drones and roars and shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forget, even unto my grave, that you refused to discount
      the note for me,&rdquo; cried some one in a fierce voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do! Is this a place for accounts?&rdquo; rang out Bobrov&rsquo;s bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brethren! Let us have some speeches!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Musicians, bush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up to the bank and I&rsquo;ll explain to you why I didn&rsquo;t discount it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A speech! Silence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Musicians, cease playing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike up &lsquo;In the Meadows.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Angot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! Yakov Tarasovich, we beg of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s called Strassburg pastry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We beg of you! We beg of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pastry? It doesn&rsquo;t look like it, but I&rsquo;ll taste it all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarasovich! Start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brethren! It is jolly! By God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in &lsquo;La Belle Helene&rsquo; she used to come out almost naked, my dear,&rdquo;
       suddenly Robustov&rsquo;s shrill and emotional voice broke through the noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out! Jacob cheated Esau? Aha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t! My tongue is not a hammer, and I am no longer young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yasha! We all implore you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do us the honour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll elect you mayor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tarasovich! don&rsquo;t be capricious!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! Silence! Gentlemen! Yakov Tarasovich will say a few words!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And just at the moment the noise subsided some one&rsquo;s loud, indignant
      whisper was heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How she pinched me, the carrion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Bobrov inquired in his deep basso:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did she pinch you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All burst into ringing laughter, but soon fell silent, for Yakov
      Tarasovich Mayakin, rising to his feet, cleared his throat, and, stroking
      his bald crown, surveyed the merchants with a serious look expecting
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, brethren, open your ears!&rdquo; shouted Kononov, with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen of the merchant class!&rdquo; began Mayakin with a smile. &ldquo;There is a
      certain foreign word in the language of intelligent and learned people,
      and that word is &lsquo;culture.&rsquo; So now I am going to talk to you about that
      word in all the simplicity of my soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, that&rsquo;s where he is aiming to!&rdquo; some ones satisfied exclamation was
      heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! Silence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear gentlemen!&rdquo; said Mayakin, raising his voice, &ldquo;in the newspapers they
      keep writing about us merchants, that we are not acquainted with this
      &lsquo;culture,&rsquo; that we do not want it, and do not understand it. And they call
      us savage, uncultured people. What is culture? It pains me, old man as I
      am, to hear such words, and one day I made it my business to look up that
      word, to see what it really contains.&rdquo; Mayakin became silent, surveyed the
      audience with his eyes, and went on distinctly, with a triumphant smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It proved, upon my researches, that this word means worship, that is,
      love, great love for business and order in life. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; I
      thought, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; That means that he is a cultured man who loves
      business and order, who, in general, loves to arrange life, loves to live,
      knows the value of himself and of life. Good!&rdquo; Yakov Tarasovich trembled,
      his wrinkles spread over his face like beams, from his smiling eyes to his
      lips, and his bald head looked like some dark star.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchants stared silently and attentively at his mouth, and all faces
      bespoke intense attention. The people seemed petrified in the attitudes in
      which Mayakin&rsquo;s speech had overtaken them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if that word is to be interpreted precisely thus, and not otherwise,
      if such is the case&mdash;then the people who call us uncultured and
      savage, slander and blaspheme us! For they love only the word, but not its
      meaning; while we love the very root of the word, we love its real
      essence, we love activity. We have within us the real cult toward life,
      that is, the worship of life; we, not they! They love reasoning&rsquo; we love
      action. And here, gentlemen of the merchant class, here is an example of
      our culture, of our love for action. Take the Volga! Here she is, our dear
      own mother! With each and every drop of her water she can corroborate our
      honour and refute the empty blasphemy spattered on us. Only one hundred
      years have elapsed, my dear sirs, since Emperor Peter the Great launched
      decked barks on this river, and now thousands of steamships sail up and
      down the river. Who has built them? The Russian peasant, an utterly
      unlettered man! All these enormous steamers, barges&mdash;whose are they?
      Ours! Who has invented them? We! Everything here is ours, everything here
      is the fruit of our minds, of our Russian shrewdness, and our great love
      for action! Nobody has assisted us in anything! We ourselves exterminated
      piracy on the Volga; at our own expense we hired troops; we exterminated
      piracy and sent out on the Volga thousands of steamers and various vessels
      over all the thousands of miles of her course. Which is the best town on
      the Volga? The one that has the most merchants. Whose are the best houses
      in town? The merchants! Who takes the most care of the poor? The merchant!
      He collects groshes and copecks, and donates hundreds of thousands of
      roubles. Who has erected the churches? We! Who contributes the most money
      to the government? The merchants! Gentlemen! to us alone is the work dear
      for its own sake, for the sake of our love for the arrangement of life,
      and we alone love order and life! And he who talks about us merely talks,
      and that&rsquo;s all! Let him talk! When the wind blows the willow rustles; when
      the wind subsides the willow is silent; and neither a cart-shaft, nor a
      broom can be made out of the willow; it is a useless tree! And from this
      uselessness comes the noise. What have they, our judges, accomplished; how
      have they adorned life? We do not know it. While our work is clearly
      evident! Gentlemen of the merchant class! Seeing in you the foremost men
      in life, most industrious and loving your labours, seeing in you the men
      who can accomplish and have accomplished everything, I now heartily, with
      respect and love for you, lift my brimming goblet, to the glorious,
      strong-souled, industrious Russian merchant class. Long may you live! May
      you succeed for the glory of Mother Russia! Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shrill, jarring shout of Mayakin called forth a deafening, triumphant
      roar from the merchants. All these big, fleshy bodies, aroused by wine and
      by the old man&rsquo;s words, stirred and uttered from their chests such a
      unanimous, massive shout that everything around them seemed to tremble and
      to quake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yakov! you are the trumpet of the Lord!&rdquo; cried Zubov, holding out his
      goblet toward Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overturning the chairs, jostling the tables, thus causing the dishes and
      the bottles to rattle and fall, the merchants, agitated, delighted, some
      with tears in their eyes, rushed toward Mayakin with goblets in their
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Do you understand what has been said here?&rdquo; asked Kononov, grasping
      Robustov by the shoulder and shaking him. &ldquo;Understand it! That was a great
      speech!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yakov Tarasovich! Come, let me embrace you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s toss, Mayakin!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike up the band.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sound a flourish! A march. &lsquo;The Persian March.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want any music! The devil take it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the music! Eh, Yakov Tarasovich! What a mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was small among my brethren, but I was favoured with understanding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You lie, Trofim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yakov! you&rsquo;ll die soon. Oh, what a pity! Words can&rsquo;t express how sorry we
      are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a funeral that is going to be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen! Let us establish a Mayakin fund! I put up a thousand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! Hold on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; Yakov Tarasovich began to speak again, quivering in every
      limb. &ldquo;And, furthermore, we are the foremost men in life and the real
      masters in our fatherland because we are&mdash;peasants!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corr-rect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Dear mother! That&rsquo;s an old man for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on! Let him finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are primitive Russian people, and everything that comes from us is
      truly Russian! Consequently it is the most genuine, the most useful and
      obligatory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As true as two and two make four!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so simple.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is as wise as a serpent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as meek as a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a hawk. Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The merchants encircled their orator in a close ring, they looked at him
      with their oily eyes, and were so agitated that they could no longer
      listen to his words calmly. Around him a tumult of voices smote the air,
      and mingling with the noise of the engine, and the beating of the wheels
      upon the water, it formed a whirlwind of sounds which drowned the jarring
      voice of the old man. The excitement of the merchants was growing more and
      more intense; all faces were radiant with triumph; hands holding out
      goblets were outstretched toward Mayakin; the merchants clapped him on the
      shoulder, jostled him, kissed him, gazed with emotion into his face. And
      some screamed ecstatically:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The kamarinsky. The national dance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have accomplished all that!&rdquo; cried Yakov Tarasovich, pointing at the
      river. &ldquo;It is all ours! We have built up life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly rang out a loud exclamation which drowned all sounds:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! So you have done it? Ah, you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And immediately after this, a vulgar oath resounded through the air,
      pronounced distinctly with great rancour, in a dull but powerful voice.
      Everyone heard it and became silent for a moment, searching with their
      eyes the man who had abused them. At this moment nothing was heard save
      the deep sighs of the engines and the clanking of the rudder chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s snarling there?&rdquo; asked Kononov with a frown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get along without scandals!&rdquo; said Reznikov, with a contrite
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was swearing here at random?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faces of the merchants mirrored alarm, curiosity, astonishment,
      reproach, and all the people began to bustle about stupidly. Only Yakov
      Tarasovich alone was calm and seemed even satisfied with what had
      occurred. Rising on tiptoe, with his neck outstretched, he stared
      somewhere toward the end of the table, and his eyes flashed strangely, as
      though he saw there something which was pleasing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gordyeeff,&rdquo; said Yona Yushkov, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all heads were turned toward the direction in which Yakov Tarasovich
      was staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, with his hands resting on the table, stood Foma. His face distorted
      with wrath, his teeth firmly set together, he silently surveyed the
      merchants with his burning, wide-open eyes. His lower jaw was trembling,
      his shoulders were quivering, and the fingers of his hands, firmly
      clutching the edge of the table, were nervously scratching the tablecloth.
      At the sight of his wolf-like, angry face and his wrathful pose, the
      merchants again became silent for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you gaping at?&rdquo; asked Foma, and again accompanied his question
      with a violent oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s drunk!&rdquo; said Bobrov, with a shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why was he invited?&rdquo; whispered Reznikov, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Foma Ignatyevich!&rdquo; said Kononov, sedately, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t create any
      scandals. If your head is reeling&mdash;go, my dear boy, quietly and
      peacefully into the cabin and lie down! Lie down, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, you!&rdquo; roared Foma, and turned his eye at him. &ldquo;Do not dare to
      speak to me! I am not drunk. I am soberer than any one of you here! Do you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wait awhile, my boy. Who invited you here?&rdquo; asked Kononov, reddening
      with offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought him!&rdquo; rang out Mayakin&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Well, then, of course. Excuse me, Foma Ignatyevich. But as you
      brought him, Yakov, you ought to subdue him. Otherwise it&rsquo;s no good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma maintained silence and smiled. And the merchants, too, were silent,
      as they looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, Fomka!&rdquo; began Mayakin. &ldquo;Again you disgrace my old age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Godfather!&rdquo; said Foma, showing his teeth, &ldquo;I have not done anything as
      yet, so it is rather early to read me a lecture. I am not drunk, I have
      drunk nothing, but I have heard everything. Gentlemen merchants! Permit me
      to make a speech! My godfather, whom you respect so much, has spoken. Now
      listen to his godson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;speeches?&rdquo; said Reznikov. &ldquo;Why have any discourses? We have
      come together to enjoy ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, you had better drop that, Foma Ignatyevich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better drink something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a drink! Ah, Foma, you&rsquo;re the son of a fine father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma recoiled from the table, straightened himself and continuously
      smiling, listened to the kind, admonitory words. Among all those sedate
      people he was the youngest and the handsomest. His well-shaped figure, in
      a tight-fitting frock coat, stood out, to his advantage, among the mass of
      stout bodies with prominent paunches. His swarthy face with large eyes was
      more regularly featured, more full of life than the shrivelled or red
      faces of those who stood before him with astonishment and expectancy. He
      threw his chest forward, set his teeth together, and flinging the skirts
      of his frock coat apart, thrust his hands into his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stop up my mouth now with flattery and caresses!&rdquo; said he,
      firmly and threateningly, &ldquo;Whether you will listen or not, I am going to
      speak all the same. You cannot drive me away from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head, and, raising his shoulders, announced calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if any one of you dare to touch me, even with a finger, I&rsquo;ll kill
      him! I swear it by the Lord. I&rsquo;ll kill as many as I can!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd of people that stood opposite him swayed back, even as bushes
      rocked by the wind. They began to talk in agitated whispers. Foma&rsquo;s face
      grew darker, his eyes became round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it has been said here that you have built up life, and that you
      have done the most genuine and proper things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma heaved a deep sigh, and with inexpressible aversion scrutinized his
      listeners&rsquo; faces, which suddenly became strangely puffed up, as though
      they were swollen. The merchants were silent, pressing closer and closer
      to one another. Some one in the back rows muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is he talking about? Ah! From a paper, or by heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you rascals!&rdquo; exclaimed Gordyeeff, shaking his head. &ldquo;What have you
      made? It is not life that you have made, but a prison. It is not order
      that you have established, you have forged fetters on man. It is
      suffocating, it is narrow, there is no room for a living soul to turn. Man
      is perishing! You are murderers! Do you understand that you exist today
      only through the patience of mankind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; exclaimed Reznikov, clasping his hands in rage and
      indignation. &ldquo;Ilya Yefimov, what&rsquo;s this? I can&rsquo;t bear to hear such words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gordyeeff!&rdquo; cried Bobrov. &ldquo;Look out, you speak improper words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For such words you&rsquo;ll get&mdash;oi, oi, oi!&rdquo; said Zubov, insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; roared Foma, with blood-shot eyes. &ldquo;Now they&rsquo;re grunting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen!&rdquo; rang out Mayakin&rsquo;s calm, malicious voice, like the screech of
      a smooth-file on iron. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch him! I entreat you earnestly, do not
      hinder him. Let him snarl. Let him amuse himself. His words cannot harm
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, I humbly thank you!&rdquo; cried Yushkov. And close at Foma&rsquo;s side
      stood Smolin and whispered in his ear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, my dear boy! What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Are you out of your wits?
      They&rsquo;ll do you&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get away!&rdquo; said Foma, firmly, flashing his angry eyes at him. &ldquo;You go to
      Mayakin and flatter him, perhaps something will come your way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Smolin whistled through his teeth and stepped aside. And the merchants
      began to disperse on the steamer, one by one. This irritated Foma still
      more he wished he could chain them to the spot by his words, but he could
      not find such powerful words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have built up life!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Who are you? Swindlers, robbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few men turned toward Foma, as if he had called them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kononov! are they soon going to try you for that little girl? They&rsquo;ll
      convict you to the galleys. Goodbye, Ilya! You are building your steamers
      in vain. They&rsquo;ll transport you to Siberia on a government vessel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kononov sank into a chair; his blood leaped to his face, and he shook his
      fist in silence. Foma said hoarsely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Good. I shall not forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma saw his distorted face with its trembling lips, and understood with
      what weapons he could deal these men the most forcible blows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha, ha! Builders of life! Gushchin, do you give alms to your little
      nephews and nieces? Give them at least a copeck a day. You have stolen
      sixty-seven thousand roubles from them. Bobrov! why did you lie about that
      mistress of yours, saying that she had robbed you, and then send her to
      prison? If you had grown tired of her, you might have given her over to
      your son. Anyway he has started an intrigue with that other mistress of
      yours. Didn&rsquo;t you know it? Eh, you fat pig, ha, ha! And you, Lup, open
      again a brothel, and fleece your guests there as before. And then the
      devil will fleece you, ha, ha! It is good to be a rascal with a pious face
      like yours! Whom did you kill then, Lup?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma spoke, interrupting his speech with loud, malevolent laughter, and
      saw that his words were producing an impression on these people. Before,
      when he had spoken to all of them they turned away from him, stepping
      aside, forming groups, and looking at their accuser from afar with anger
      and contempt. He saw smiles on their faces, he felt in their every
      movement something scornful, and understood that while his words angered
      them they did not sting as deep as he wished them to. All this had chilled
      his wrath, and within him there was already arising the bitter
      consciousness of the failure of his attack on them. But as soon as he
      began to speak of each one separately, there was a swift and striking
      change in the relation of his hearers toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Kononov sank heavily in the chair, as though he were unable to
      withstand the weight of Foma&rsquo;s harsh words, Foma noticed that bitter and
      malicious smiles crossed the faces of some of the merchants. He heard some
      one&rsquo;s whisper of astonishment and approval:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well aimed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This whisper gave strength to Foma, and he confidently and passionately
      began to hurl reproaches, jeers and abuses at those who met his eyes. He
      growled joyously, seeing that his words were taking effect. He was
      listened to silently, attentively; several men moved closer toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exclamations of protest were heard, but these were brief, not loud, and
      each time Foma shouted some one&rsquo;s name, all became silent, listening,
      casting furtive, malicious glances in the direction of their accused
      comrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bobrov laughed perplexedly, but his small eyes bored into Foma as gimlets.
      And Lup Reznikov, waving his hands, hopped about awkwardly and, short of
      breath, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be my witnesses. What&rsquo;s this! No-o! I will not forgive this! I&rsquo;ll go to
      court. What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; and suddenly he screamed in a shrill voice,
      out-stretching his hand toward Foma:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bind him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma was laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot bind the truth, you can&rsquo;t do it! Even bound, truth will not
      grow dumb!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go-o-od!&rdquo; drawled out Kononov in a dull, broken voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, gentlemen of the merchant class!&rdquo; rang out Mayakin&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I
      ask! you to admire him, that&rsquo;s the kind of a fellow he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One after another the merchants moved toward Foma, and on their faces he
      saw wrath, curiosity, a malicious feeling of satisfaction, fear. Some one
      of those modest people among whom Foma was sitting, whispered to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to them. God bless you. Go ahead! That will be to your credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robustov!&rdquo; cried Foma. &ldquo;What are you laughing at? What makes you glad?
      You will also go to the galleys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him ashore!&rdquo; suddenly roared Robustov, springing to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Kononov shouted to the captain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Back! To the town! To the Governor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And someone insinuatingly, in a voice trembling with feeling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a collusive agreement. That was done on purpose. He was
      instigated, and made drunk to give him courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a revolt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bind him! Just bind him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma grasped a champagne bottle and swung it in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on now! No, it seems that you will have to listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With renewed fury, frantic with joy at seeing these people shrinking and
      quailing under the blows of his words, Foma again started to shout names
      and vulgar oaths, and the exasperated tumult was hushed once more. The
      men, whom Foma did not know, gazed at him with eager curiosity, with
      approval, while some looked at him even with joyous surprise. One of them,
      a gray-haired little old man with rosy cheeks and small mouse eyes,
      suddenly turned toward the merchants, who had been abused by Foma, and
      said in a sweet voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are words from the conscience! That&rsquo;s nothing! You must endure it.
      That&rsquo;s a prophetic accusation. We are sinful. To tell the truth we are
      very&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was hissed, and Zubov even jostled him on the shoulder. He made a low
      bow and disappeared in the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zubov!&rdquo; cried Foma. &ldquo;How many people have you fleeced and turned to
      beggars? Do you ever dream of Ivan Petrov Myakinnikov, who strangled
      himself because of you? Is it true that you steal at every mass ten
      roubles out of the church box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zubov had not expected the attack, and he remained as petrified, with his
      hand uplifted. But he immediately began to scream in a shrill voice, as he
      jumped up quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You turn against me also? Against me, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he puffed up his cheeks and furiously began to shake his fist
      at Foma, as he screamed in a shrill voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fool says in his heart there is no God! I&rsquo;ll go to the bishop!
      Infidel! You&rsquo;ll get the galleys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tumult on the steamer grew, and at the sight of these enraged,
      perplexed and insulted people, Foma felt himself a fairy-tale giant,
      slaying monsters. They bustled about, waving their arms, talking to one
      another&mdash;some red with anger, others pale, yet all equally powerless
      to check the flow of his jeers at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send the sailors over here!&rdquo; cried Reznikov, tugging Kononov by the
      shoulder. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, Ilya? Ah? Have you invited us to be
      ridiculed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Against one puppy,&rdquo; screamed Zubov.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd had gathered around Yakov Tarasovitch Mayakin, and listened to his
      quiet speech with anger, and nodded their heads affirmatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Act, Yakov!&rdquo; said Robustov, loudly. &ldquo;We are all witnesses. Go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And above the general tumult of voices rang out Foma&rsquo;s loud, accusing
      voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not life that you have built&mdash;you have made a cesspool! You
      have bred filth and putrefaction by your deeds! Have you a conscience? Do
      you remember God? Money&mdash;that&rsquo;s your God! And your conscience you
      have driven away. Whither have you driven it away? Blood-suckers! You live
      on the strength of others. You work with other people&rsquo;s hands! You shall
      pay for all this! When you perish, you will be called to account for
      everything! For everything, even to a teardrop. How many people have wept
      blood at those great deeds of yours? And according to your deserts, even
      hell is too good a place for you, rascals. Not in fire, but in boiling mud
      you shall be scorched. Your sufferings shall last for centuries. The
      devils will hurl you into a boiler and will pour into it&mdash;ha, ha, ha!
      they&rsquo;ll pour into it&mdash;ha, ha, ha! Honourable merchant class! Builders
      of Life. Oh, you devils!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma burst into ringing laughter, and, holding his sides, staggered,
      tossing his head up high.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment several men quickly exchanged glances, simultaneously
      rushed on Foma and downed him with their weight. A racket ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re caught!&rdquo; ejaculated some one in a suffocating voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Is that the way you&rsquo;re doing it?&rdquo; cried Foma, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      For about a half a minute a whole heap of black bodies bustled about on
      one spot, heavily stamping their feet, and dull exclamations were heard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw him to the ground!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold his hand, his hand! Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the beard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get napkins, bind him with napkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll bite, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So! Well, how&rsquo;s it? Aha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t strike! Don&rsquo;t dare to strike.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strong he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s carry him over there toward the side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out in the fresh air, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They dragged Foma away to one side, and having placed him against the wall
      of the captain&rsquo;s cabin, walked away from him, adjusting their costumes,
      and mopping their sweat-covered brows. Fatigued by the struggle, and
      exhausted by the disgrace of his defeat, Foma lay there in silence,
      tattered, soiled with something, firmly bound, hand and foot, with napkins
      and towels. With round, blood-shot eyes he gazed at the sky; they were
      dull and lustreless, as those of an idiot, and his chest heaved unevenly
      and with difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now came their turn to mock him. Zubov began. He walked up to him, kicked
      him in the side and asked in a soft voice, all trembling with the pleasure
      of revenge:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thunder-like prophet, how is it? Now you can taste the sweetness of
      Babylonian captivity, he, he, he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Foma, hoarsely, without looking at him. &ldquo;Wait until I&rsquo;m
      rested. You have not tied up my tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But saying this, Foma understood that he could no longer do anything, nor
      say anything. And that not because they had bound him, but because
      something had burned out within him, and his soul had become dark and
      empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zubov was soon joined by Reznikov. Then one after another the others began
      to draw near. Bobrov, Kononov and several others preceded by Yakov Mayakin
      went to the cabin, anxiously discussing something in low tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer was sailing toward the town at full speed. The bottles on the
      tables trembled and rattled from the vibration of the steamer, and Foma
      heard this jarring, plaintive sound above everything else. Near him stood
      a throng of people, saying malicious, offensive things.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Foma saw them as though through a fog, and their words did not touch
      him to the quick. A vast, bitter feeling was now springing up within him,
      from the depth of his soul; he followed its growth and though he did not
      yet understand it, he already experienced something melancholy and
      degrading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think, you charlatan! What have you done to yourself?&rdquo; said
      Reznikov. &ldquo;What sort of a life is now possible to you? Do you know that
      now no one of us would care even as much as to spit on you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo; Foma tried to understand. The merchants stood around
      him in a dense, dark mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Yashchurov, &ldquo;now, Fomka, your work is done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; bellowed Zubov in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me free!&rdquo; said Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no! we thank you humbly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Untie me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right! You can lie that way as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call up my godfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Yakov Tarasovich came up at this moment. He came up, stopped near
      Foma, sternly surveyed with his eyes the outstretched figure of his
      godson, and heaved a deep sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Foma,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order them to unbind me,&rdquo; entreated Foma, softly, in a mournful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you can be turbulent again? No, no, you&rsquo;d better lie this way,&rdquo; his
      godfather replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say another word. I swear it by God! Unbind me. I am ashamed! For
      Christ&rsquo;s sake. You see I am not drunk. Well, you needn&rsquo;t untie my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You swear that you&rsquo;ll not be troublesome?&rdquo; asked Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lord! I will not, I will not,&rdquo; moaned Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      They untied his feet, but left his hands bound. When he rose, he looked at
      them all, and said softly with a pitiful smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We always shall!&rdquo; replied his godfather, smiling sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma bent, with his hands tied behind his back, advanced toward the table
      silently, without lifting his eyes to anyone. He seemed shorter in stature
      and thinner. His dishevelled hair fell on his forehead and temples; the
      torn and crumpled bosom of his shirt protruding from under his vest, and
      the collar covered his lips. He turned his head to push the collar down
      under his chin, and was unable to do it. Then the gray-headed little old
      man walked up to him, adjusted what was necessary, looked into his eyes
      with a smile and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must endure it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, in Mayakin&rsquo;s presence, those who had mocked Foma were silent, looking
      at the old man questioningly, with curiosity and expectancy. He was calm
      but his eyes gleamed in a way not at all becoming to the occasion,
      contentedly and brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me some vodka,&rdquo; begged Foma, seating himself at the table, and
      leaning his chest against its edge. His bent figure look piteous and
      helpless. Around they were talking in whispers, passing this way and that
      cautiously. And everyone looked now at him, now at Mayakin, who had seated
      himself opposite him. The old man did not give Foma the vodka at once.
      First he surveyed him fixedly, then he slowly poured out a wine glassful,
      and finally, without saying a word, raised it to Foma&rsquo;s lips. Foma drank
      the vodka, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; replied Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      And immediately after this there fell a minute of perfect, painful
      silence. People were coming up to the table noiselessly, on tiptoe, and
      when they were near they stretched their necks to see Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Fomka, do you understand now what you have done?&rdquo; asked Mayakin. He
      spoke softly, but all heard his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma nodded his head and maintained silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no forgiveness for you!&rdquo; Mayakin went on firmly, and raising his
      voice. &ldquo;Though we are all Christians, yet you will receive no forgiveness
      at our hands. Just know this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma lifted his head and said pensively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have quite forgotten about you, godfather. You have not heard anything
      from me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have it!&rdquo; exclaimed Mayakin, bitterly, pointing at his godson.
      &ldquo;You see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A dull grumble of protest burst forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all the same!&rdquo; resumed Foma with a sigh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same!
      Nothing&mdash;no good came out of it anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And again he bent over the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you want?&rdquo; asked Mayakin, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I wanted?&rdquo; Foma raised his head, looked at the merchants and smiled.
      &ldquo;I wanted&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drunkard! Nasty scamp!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not drunk!&rdquo; retorted Foma, morosely. &ldquo;I have drank only two glasses.
      I was perfectly sober.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequently,&rdquo; said Bobrov, &ldquo;you are right, Yakov Tarasovich, he is
      insane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; exclaimed Foma.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they paid no attention to him. Reznikov, Zubov and Bobrov leaned over
      to Mayakin and began to talk in low tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guardianship!&rdquo; Foma&rsquo;s ears caught this one word. &ldquo;I am in my right mind!&rdquo;
       he said, leaning back in his chair and staring at the merchants with
      troubled eyes. &ldquo;I understand what I wanted. I wanted to speak the truth. I
      wanted to accuse you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was again seized with emotion, and he suddenly jerked his hands in an
      effort to free them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! Hold on!&rdquo; exclaimed Bobrov, seizing him by the shoulders. &ldquo;Hold him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hold me!&rdquo; said Foma with sadness and bitterness. &ldquo;Hold me&mdash;what
      do you need me for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit still!&rdquo; cried his godfather, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foma became silent. He now understood that what he had done was of no
      avail, that his words had not staggered the merchants. Here they stood,
      surrounding him in a dense throng, and he could not see anything for them.
      They were calm, firm, treating him as a drunkard and a turbulent fellow,
      and were plotting something against him. He felt himself pitiful,
      insignificant, crushed by that dark mass of strong-souled, clever and
      sedate people. It seemed to him that a long time had passed since he had
      abused them, so long a time that he himself seemed as a stranger,
      incapable of comprehending what he had done to these people, and why he
      had done it. He even experienced in himself a certain feeling of offence,
      which resembled shame at himself in his own eyes. There was a tickling
      sensation in his throat, and he felt there was something foreign in his
      breast, as though some dust or ashes were strewn upon his heart, and it
      throbbed unevenly and with difficulty. Wishing to explain to himself his
      act, he said slowly and thoughtfully, without looking at anyone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to speak the truth. Is this life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; said Mayakin, contemptuously. &ldquo;What truth can you speak? What do
      you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart is wounded, that I understand! What justification have you all
      in the eyes of God? To what purpose do you live? Yes, I feel&mdash;I felt
      the truth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is repenting!&rdquo; said Reznikov, with a sarcastic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him!&rdquo; replied Bobrov, with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is evident, from his words, that he is out of his wits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To speak the truth, that&rsquo;s not given to everyone!&rdquo; said Yakov Tarasovich,
      sternly and instructively, lifting his hand upward. &ldquo;It is not the heart
      that grasps truth; it is the mind; do you understand that? And as to your
      feeling, that&rsquo;s nonsense! A cow also feels when they twist her tail. But
      you must understand, understand everything! Understand also your enemy.
      Guess what he thinks even in his dreams, and then go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      According to his wont, Mayakin was carried away by the exposition of his
      practical philosophy, but he realised in time that a conquered man is not
      to be taught how to fight, and he stopped short. Foma cast at him a dull
      glance, and shook his head strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lamb!&rdquo; said Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave me alone!&rdquo; entreated Foma, plaintively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all yours! Well, what
      else do you want? Well, you crushed me, bruised me, that serves me right!
      Who am I? O Lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All listened attentively to his words, and in that attention there was
      something prejudiced, something malicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lived,&rdquo; said Foma in a heavy voice. &ldquo;I have observed. I have
      thought; my heart has become wounded with thoughts! And here&mdash;the
      abscess burst. Now I am utterly powerless! As though all my blood had
      gushed out. I have lived until this day, and still thought that now I will
      speak the truth. Well, I have spoken it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He talked monotonously, colourlessly, and his speech resembled that of one
      in delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have spoken it, and I have only emptied myself, that&rsquo;s all. Not a trace
      have my words left behind them. Everything is uninjured. And within me
      something blazed up; it has burned out, and there&rsquo;s nothing more there.
      What have I to hope for now? And everything remains as it was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yakov Tarasovich burst into bitter laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then, did you think to lick away a mountain with your tongue? You
      armed yourself with malice enough to fight a bedbug, and you started out
      after a bear, is that it? Madman! If your father were to see you now. Eh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Foma, suddenly, loudly, with assurance, and his eyes again
      flared up, &ldquo;and yet it is all your fault! You have spoiled life! You have
      made everything narrow. We are suffocating because of you! And though my
      truth against you is weak, it is truth, nevertheless! You are godless
      wretches! May you all be cursed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved about in his chair, attempting to free his hands, and cried out,
      flashing his eyes with fury:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unbind my hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They came closer to him; the faces of the merchants became more severe,
      and Reznikov said to him impressively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make a noise, don&rsquo;t be bothersome! We&rsquo;ll soon be in town. Don&rsquo;t
      disgrace yourself, and don&rsquo;t disgrace us either. We are not going to take
      you direct from the wharf to the insane asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; exclaimed Foma. &ldquo;So you are going to put me into an insane asylum?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one replied. He looked at their faces and hung his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behave peacefully! We&rsquo;ll unbind you!&rdquo; said someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not necessary!&rdquo; said Foma in a low voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same. I spit
      on it! Nothing will happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And his speech again assumed the nature of a delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am lost, I know it! Only not because of your power, but rather because
      of my weakness. Yes! You, too, are only worms in the eyes of God. And,
      wait! You shall choke. I am lost through blindness. I saw much and I
      became blind, like an owl. As a boy, I remember, I chased an owl in a
      ravine; it flew about and struck against something. The sun blinded it. It
      was all bruised and it disappeared, and my father said to me then: &lsquo;It is
      the same with man; some man bustles about to and fro, bruises himself,
      exhausts himself, and then throws himself anywhere, just to rest.&rsquo; Hey I
      unbind my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face turned pale, his eyes closed, his shoulders quivered. Tattered
      and crumpled he rocked about in the chair, striking his chest against the
      edge of the table, and began to whisper something.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchants exchanged significant glances. Some, nudging one another in
      the sides, shook their heads at Foma in silence. Yakov Mayakin&rsquo;s face was
      dark and immobile as though hewn out of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we perhaps unbind him?&rdquo; whispered Bobrov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we get a little nearer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not necessary,&rdquo; said Mayakin in an undertone-&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave him
      here. Let someone send for a carriage. We&rsquo;ll take him straight to the
      asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where am I to rest?&rdquo; Foma muttered again. &ldquo;Whither shall I fling
      myself?&rdquo; And he remained as though petrified in a broken, uncomfortable
      attitude, all distorted, with an expression of pain on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mayakin rose from his seat and went to the cabin, saying softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep an eye on him, he might fling himself overboard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for the fellow,&rdquo; said Bobrov, looking at Yakov Tarasovich as
      he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one is to blame for his madness,&rdquo; replied Reznikov, morosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Yakov,&rdquo; whispered Zubov, nodding his head in the direction of
      Mayakin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Yakov? He loses nothing through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, now he&rsquo;ll, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be his guardian, ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their quiet laughter and whisper mingled with the groaning of the engine
      did not seem to reach Foma&rsquo;s ear. Motionlessly he stared into the distance
      before him with a dim look, and only his lips were slightly quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His son has returned,&rdquo; whispered Bobrov.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know his son,&rdquo; said Yashchurov. &ldquo;I met him in Perm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a man is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A business-like, clever fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He manages a big business in Oosolye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Consequently Yakov does not need this one. Yes. So that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, he&rsquo;s weeping!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foma was sitting leaning against the back of the chair, and drooping his
      head on the shoulder. His eyes were shut, and from under his eyelids tears
      were trickling one after another. They coursed down his cheeks into his
      moustache. Foma&rsquo;s lips quivered convulsively, and the tears fell from his
      moustache upon his breast. He was silent and motionless, only his chest
      heaved unevenly, and with difficulty. The merchants looked at his pale,
      tear-stained face, grown lean with suffering, with the corners of his lips
      lowered downward, and walked away from him quietly and mutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Foma remained alone, with his hands tied behind his back, sitting
      at the table which was covered with dirty dishes and different remains of
      the feast. At times he slowly opened his heavy, swollen eyelids, and his
      eyes, through tears, looked dimly and mournfully at the table where
      everything was dirty, upset, ruined.
    </p>
    <p>
      .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years have passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a year ago Yakov Tarasovich Mayakin died. He died in full
      consciousness, and remained true to himself; a few hours before his death
      he said to his son, daughter and son-in-law:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, children, live in richness! Yakov has tasted everything, so now it
      is time for Yakov to go. You see, I am dying, yet I am not despondent; and
      the Lord will set that down to my credit. I have bothered Him, the Most
      Gracious One, with jests only, but never with moans and complaints! Oh
      Lord! I am glad that I have lived with understanding through Thy mercy!
      Farewell, my children. Live in harmony, and don&rsquo;t philosophize too much.
      Know this, not he is holy who hides himself from sin and lies calm. With
      cowardice you cannot defend yourself against sin, thus also says the
      parable of the talents. But he who wants to attain his goal in life fears
      not sin. God will pardon him an error. God has appointed man as the
      builder of life, but has not endowed him with too much wisdom.
      Consequently, He will not call in his outstanding debts severely. For He
      is holy and most merciful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He died after a short but very painful agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yozhov was for some reason or other banished from the town soon after the
      occurrence on the steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great commercial house sprang up in the town under the firm-name of
      &ldquo;Taras Mayakin &amp; African Smolin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nothing had been heard of Foma during these three years. It was rumoured
      that upon his discharge from the asylum Mayakin had sent him away to some
      relatives of his mother in the Ural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long ago Foma appeared in the streets of the town. He is worn out,
      shabby and half-witted. Almost always intoxicated, he appears now gloomy,
      with knitted brow, and with head bent down on his breast, now smiling the
      pitiful and melancholy smile of a silly fanatic. Sometimes he is
      turbulent, but that happens rarely. He lives with his foster-sister in a
      little wing in the yard. His acquaintances among the merchants and
      citizens often ridicule him. As Foma walks along the street, suddenly
      someone shouts to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, you prophet, come here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yet he rarely goes to those who call him; he shuns people and does not
      care to speak with them. But when he does approach them they say to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tell us something about doomsday, won&rsquo;t you? Ha, ha, ha! Prophet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
